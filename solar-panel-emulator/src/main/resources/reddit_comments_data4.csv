The faces could use a bit of Cadian Fleshtone wash to darken the features and add some depth.and I noticed some mold lines at a few points that could do with some trimming. I like the color scheme, the contrast and practicality of it really suits the Tau.

Lore-wise I was under the impression that humans assimilated into the Tau Empire weren't allowed to use Fire Caste weapons and maintained their own weapons like las guns and such. Also since they are no longer loyal Imperial subjects you should probably remove the Imperial Aquila on their helmets and armor. The rule-of-cool of course trumps all of that and means that you have a very cool, very Tau unit."

cquh5if&hearthstone&Popsychblog&"I can understand the appeal of that strategy. I've tried making several decks around best case thinking; I still do even to this day. Each time I do, I end up making substantial changes once I test it and figure out my opponents play cards too, and those cards tend to interfere with my best cases a lot.  

For instance, consider the knife jugglers. They're good with muster for battle, but otherwise they seem to have little synergy with the deck. You might get a knife each turn on average, but that's not really great value for a card slot. They might have worked fine in the quartermaster deck, but a dragon deck has a different objective and requires different considerations. Maybe they'll end up making the final list; maybe not. I just don't think they're too great. 

Harrison is an interesting card, and one I tend to stick away from for the most part. While I like pulling him off, Harrison is both a tech card and a reactive one, making it rather difficult to use. Even if you do pull him off, you're paladin; the payoff in the form of card draw is often not that great since you're not really hurting for cards often. "

In the beginning of KSP, there were only three Kerbals: Jeb, Bill, and Bob. Jeb was always the first one assigned to your ships, and the others would follow if you needed more crew. This means that everyone who's been playing KSP for a while has spent a *lot* of time with Jeb. Mostly blowing him up.

The thing about Jeb is he literally has a different personality from everyone else. Throughout your missions, you have a little face cam that show your Kerbal's reactions. Jeb is *always* thrilled with whatever is going on. Unless death is *eminent*, you'll never see a hint of fear on Jeb.

And that's why people love him. After all the countless times we've blown Jeb up, and slammed him into planets, and doomed him to orbit the sun for centuries, he's still [smiling like a madman](http://i.imgur.com/eDIkvJA.png)."

Also I may suggest you the browser plugins Rikaichan (Firefox)/Rikaikun (Chrome) if you do not know them, they are excellent for learning kanjis, reading names, and such!

Like everyone stated there is a LOT under the hood going on, but little in regards to building a larger community which kind of sucks. I've gone to the local game shop and most play MtG and have no clue about Hex, or haven't seen anything yet so it's not even in their mind. Same thing with my Hearthstone friends, they think Naxxaramas and Blackrock are these awesome PvE aspects and the game is super deep, and won't give Hex a chance because they've only heard of it through what I tell them.

We need youtube videos, ads, a commercial,  articles on game sites, SOMETHING more than currently is out to get more people to know and get hyped for what I think is a great game with an already growing community. I like Hearthstone a lot too but I think it could be usurped if only more people even streamers started trying it out. Especially the hearth 'pros'"

This really boosts the ""grandeur"" feeling of the subject, as you are shooting from below, and to the side so it really sticks out as a big, metal plane, plus it makes for a very eye pleasing photograph with a clear, defined subject!

For example, the new battle sprites look great. The contrast is well-done and the details are well-executed. The models work especially well because they are the highlight of the scene. *Why?* In battle, all I'm focused on are my players and enemies; the background is intentionally insignificant. High levels of technical execution and design unity make for a good change.

cquh5t7&recipes&nygreenguy&"I'm a huge fan of habichuelas rosada, Puerto Rican pink beans. They were a big reason I eat beans now. I'll give you my quick and easy (as opposed to long and more traditional) recipe.

You need 2 cans goya pink beans drained, frozen goya sofrito, small can goya tomato sauce, goya sazon, goya jamon  (basically ham bullion, can use cooked bacon or salt pork), garlic, few olives, adobo, and a starch like potato, sweet potato, or pumpkin. 

Add beans and sauce to saucepan, add 2 tablespoons sofrito, olives, and cook on medium heat until warm. Add the sazon, jamon, adobo (1/2 tsp) and 1 or 2 tomato sauce cans of water. This determines how thick or thin your sauce will be. Chop your starch to 1 inch cubes, add to pot, bring to a boil and simmer for 20 min or until starch is soft. 

Serve over rice. Delicious!

However, many white collar crimes end in settlements because the prosecution knows the evidence they have may not hold up in a court. An since those cases are criminal they deserve the same scrutiny in court as anyone else does, that is, having the burden of proof on the prosecution.

If it is a civil procedure, they can settle or the court can assign partial liability for the charges if the evidence is not strong enough. "

cquh5tv&leagueoflegends&Evilbunz&"I hope almost all of you watch the ADCL everyday on twitch because I am there every day talking in twitch chat and calling out their bot / top lane on a dialy basis for being bad.

This is not new... Misfit relies too heavily on Alex and Crumbzz. Their bot lane simply isn't on par and neither is their top laner to even low level LCS teams. 

And against C9T even if Alex plays as best as he can it isn't enough because their bot / top lane are just not good enough even in comparison to low level LCS teams at the moment. Can this change in the future sure... a lot of things can change but right now this is where they are at."

The Hyundai doesn't last quite as long as either the Toyota or Honda but the parts are dirt cheap and they can be bought for very little which makes it great if you aren't going to drive much.

cquh5yp&nba&Jeff_ree&"And how the fuck does that relate at all to the tweet in question? The only way it's relevant to mention that resisting potentially offensive ""expressions, tropes, or stereotypes"" can be useful to a society in a discussion about that tweet is if that tweet is somehow in the same vein as any of those things, which it isn't. 

The only reason the guy got fired is because it's PR and anything that offends anyone is a no go (unlike real life), not because it's actually bad at all. And it isn't. So the people who are offended by the tweet are not somehow vindicated because the same criticism that points out why they're full of shit here has also been used unsuccessfully against stereotypes etc that actually were bad for society.

TL;DR: just because people who have crusaded against political correctness have been full of shit before doesn't mean the people doing it in this instance (basically just because a dude lost his job) are full of shit now."

Plus they can still work hard and protect their family. That hasn't been taken away or changed. I think if you're interested in building character, there are limitless character building activities awaiting you. But guys don't want to and don't seek them out. I don't think the world is that different, but I haven't been around for all of it so I couldn't say for sure. I just know that every guy in my life has been a confused man child, and I never know what to do or say or what is reasonable to expect of them. It's kind of a cluster fuck out there.

He's definitely the harder of the two but, in my opinion, much more fun and a bigger playmaker. You'll find that you can play Thresh very aggressively if you so choose. Leona has an all-in style of play that's reliant on follow-up, but with Thresh you aren't forced to go in if you land a hook. He's great at turning around an engage or disengaging completely. Also consider that his Flay counters Leona's Zenith Blade :^ ). Invest enough time in Thresh and I think you'll find him very rewarding.

Good point.  I will e-mail SMC tonight.

I am in the United States.  I am also in a state where all my one party consent recording was totally legal.  I even checked with the policeman who does off-duty security for the commercial property at night just to make sure what I read online was correct.  *insert one small giggle because I bet if I recorded him on duty it would be different*

Glad to hear you got treated right at the unemployment office.  That gives me hope.

I deleted my internet history.  I created new accounts for both work computers, made them Administrators, and deleted the original accounts (that was more so my name wouldn't be on the computers, but side benefits).

I have also been in the habit of taking my laptop to work every day for Netflix anyway.  All my redditing was done from my laptop.  While I did sometimes use one of the two work computers to look things up in incognito mode (and also to print off the form for the IRS lol)... well, if she were to pay somebody to do forensic recovery on that computer, I don't care.  There is really nothing on there that would do anything other than prove that I questioned her word on suspicious circumstances and researched it.  And a lot of these things, she bounced off me - I guess in retrospect because after ""shooting down"" my arguments/objections, she felt practiced for other people...

I see your point, but I really do not think they could consider me complicit for anything except the closeout machines - and that would still be a dramatic error IM[admittedly less than impartial]O.  I have the phone call where we talk about that, I'll have to hope it's good enough.  That wouldn't be enough of a reason to not say something anyway.

Thank you again!  Updates will be coming.  Promise."

Chances are she will complain no matter what you get her so no point in trying to find a ""real"" gift for her to enjoy (because she won't). If she likes books at all the thrift store is a great place to get $1 books as well. 

I gave my mother gift cards for birthdays and mother's day for the last few years because she is so hard to buy for, complains about everything, and/or won't use it or regifts it. This year I thought of something she might possibly enjoy and got it for her instead of a gift card, and my mind was put at ease with the mantra ""if she doesn't like it, she can eat shit."" Such a calming thing to say to yourself, believe it or not.

cquh63w&Naruto&silverinferno3&I like to think that Ashura and Indra kept jumping between reincarnations until they found Naruto and Sasuke. They went from Hiruzen-Danzo to Jiraiya-Orochimaru (which may explain his love for the Rinnegan/Sharingan) to Kakashi-Obito, but none of them really fit the bill. Naruto and Sasuke, however were almost exactly like the brothers, so they stuck with them. This does, of course Indra and Ashura's chakras have some sort of sentience to them.

cquh66a&leagueoflegends&TheMayorOfCanTown&"Look I don't like the idea of chromas either, and I won't be buying any myself, but people need to stop trying to ""subtly"" be like well its not a REAL skin so lemme have it for free. I'm broke as shit, I'm not a gamer really, I just love playing League with a couple buddies of mine, it's given me more sheer hours of enjoyment than any other game and they gave it to me for free. I bought a couple skins when I had a bit of extra money, namely Astronaut, and I wanted the skins for sure, but mostly I was glad that a broke ass motherfucker like me could afford to pay what little I could back to RIOT for the gift they gave me for free. Its a free game, if you like playing it then you gotta quit bitching about them trying to make money, how the fuck do you think they are capable of releasing new champions, balance shifts, and all the other fucktons of programming they have to do? Like fuck man, it's free to play, it's the most popular game in the world, it's helping gamers make the first strides towards being respected (outside of Korea) for their skills, and it's constantly evolving. That doesn't happen for free, neither do the servers, or the work RIOT is tryin to do to make competitive E-Sports a thing that people who don't game don't immediately scoff at. 

I dunno man, just seems like a lot of people do a lot of bitching about the free to play game they spend endless hours on. So you lagged for a few games, or found a bug, people always seem to rag on RIOT's programming, but fuck man, at least they're DOING it, could you? Doesn't seem like it has any more problems than should be expected for such a big game, or any more than are found in any number of other games to me. If you're playing a game that didn't cost you a dime on a regular basis, if it's something you enjoy and was made available to you for free just fucking chill out already. The game was free, now you want free access to the way they can earn revenue without making anyone pay for the game as well? Get real man, this isn't freemium shit, it's just visual changes for people who can afford to grab a look they like more, it doesn't make the game unbalanced or unfair or take anything away from you. I see people complaining that they've played so much league that they have insane amounts of IP and nothing to buy with it, so let them get some chromas with it, and I'm just like, what, really? You spent so much time playing a game that was free that you can't buy anymore content with the free in game money they give you so that it can make money and not become a pay to win game. And those countless hours of playing a free video game that let you accrue more free in game cash than you need to unlock every character and all the runes available, so you're somehow entitled to free access to more shit too? Oh but you've been playing since SEASON ONE MAN, LEAGUE WOULDN'T EXIST WITHOUT YOU, right? Well that's weird, because it didn't get this big just cause you were one of the people who got in on the ground floor, there were a fuck of a lot of people that were right that with you, and aren't asking for more free bells and whistles because they're somehow owed it since it's not that expensive for riot to make color changes? You got hours of free enjoyment, you weren't OWED that, you were GIVEN that, and you sure as shit aren't entitled to more free content. Just because the free to play business model worked well enough for RIOT to make money off of something they aren't charging their players anything for doesn't mean that they should have to give people more free shit. It means they made a great thing and gave it out for free and still made money off of it. That's called succeeding at business, and being cool people who managed to become a successful business while still making the content that they produce 100% free to play. Why don't you go make a better, more popular, free game without any incentives to actually, I dunno, pay you for your work, and then you can bitch ok? I'm fucking 24, I didn't go to college, wasn't a good enough student to get a scholarship, wasn't able to pay for it, I'm bat shit crazy with chronic insomnia and bipolar disorder, you think I'm rolling in dough? In this economy? In our generation? I have friends with four year degrees glad they were able to find a job paying just about minimum wage, because they have a full time job which they spent months and months applying and working anywhere and everywhere without ever getting hired for more than part time. Shit's tough for our generation, we're becoming adults in a world that has less and less incentive to hire us, or treat us fairly, and lots of ordinary people just born into poverty, because they aren't smarter or better or more experienced at anything than the people who are lucky enough to have a leg up, there's a lot people in our generation who just can't find work, and it's not like welfare checks and food stamps leave you lots of cash to spend on entertainment, 15 bucks for a movie that's an hour and a half long? Some unbelievably expensive monthly rate for cable, another for internet, because they're the only game in town and if you want either you don't have any alternatives, I don't even own a console anymore, but games are like what, 60 bucks? Most with like 2 hours of campaign and limited replay value? We need people like RIOT and webcomic writers and everonye else who is finding ways to make money off the people who CAN pay, and still let those who just can't afford it legally access it? Fuck man, be thankful someones figuring out new ways to produce entertainment without charging you a dime for it, especially if you're one of those people who can't afford to buy skins and shit. I mean, if the price of a chroma pack is unreasonable to you, surely anything that's not free to play is out of your price range, so you must be pirating everything else, and what with the internet service providers actually trying to catch people pirating now it's become like speeding, everyone does it, but the more you do it the more likely you'll get caught, fuck up enough and they'll discontinue your service now. Poor older hippie friend of mine got his internet cut because he got caught downloading a couple times, which was the first time I've ever seen that happen, but it proved that it can, and now he has no internet.  Be happy there are companies who realize that their are better solutions to piracy then punishing the poor and are doing what they can to provide free legal entertainment and just quit bitching already. I've been up for 3 days so I have no clue if I'm making sense, but I'm too out of it to notice I'm ranting like a crazy person til I've already done it, so fuck it, here's my 2 cents, which I will not actually be donating because I'm a crazy fucking broke as loser.

cquh66e&gaming&Rosti_LFC&"Your argument basically is just ""That's how they've done it"", which doesn't actually counter the argument that Steam is a bad way of doing it if all you want is the DRM. Just because Steam IS the DRM doesn't mean it had to be that way. 

You don't need DRM to run locally in its own application that permanently sucks resources in the background. Starcraft II has DRM through Battlenet accounts and everything above the game is handled on Blizzard's side, and for the most part it seems to work pretty flawlessly in my experience. 

Steam is a DRM second. It's main use is for Valve to directly advertise at you to buy more video games every time you want to play a game that runs on it. I find it convenient as a client considering I have a lot of PC games and most of them run through it, but for anyone with a fairly small library I could easily see why it'd piss them off. "

cquh66m&financialindependence&cscq_throwaway3&"It really doesn't take 7 years if you start when you're older.  It only seems that way because the people who do start coding that early in life don't get nearly as much out of it.  A year spent programming while you're in high school is way less valuable than a year in college when you're studying computer science, which in turn is less valuable than when you do it 8 hours a day for a living working on real products.  If you can get to the bare minimum skill level to get an entry level position, you will learn far more quickly on the job than someone who can spare maybe 2 hours a day in high school.

In Arrow, him joining is just lame. It shows he's weaker and hes back to killing. Batman never killing anyone (while stupid for a superhero) was looked to be so badass. Even if its a ruse and Oliver is just play acting it will still be bad.

cquh69f&AskReddit&douglasg14b&"Lets calculate this shall we?

A marble has a diameter of ~2cm, this gives it a volume of 4.189cm^3. 

Neutron star material has an averaged density of 3*10^26 Kg/Km^3. (https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/learning_center/ASM/ns.html)

* 300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Kg/ Km^3 (~50x the mass of the earth)
* 300,000,000,000,000,000 Kg/m^3 (3*10^17) (~The mass of [Prometheus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_\(moon\)))
* 300,000,000,000 Kg/cm^3 (~3x the global biomass of all fish or ~30x the biomass of the entire human species)

Each marble will have the mass of 1.2567*10^12 (1,256,700,000,000 Kg)

10,000 marble-sized neutron stars will have the mass o1.2567*10^16 (~ the mass of [951 Gaspra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/951_Gaspra))

The terminal velocity of a sphere 2cm in diameter, and with a density of 3*10^11 Kg/cm^3 is: 348,640,771m/s, or 1,255,106,777Km/h. This is probably broken, I doubt the math is supposed to work with objects with that kind of mass, lets assume it accelerates at 9.8m/s^2 for the entire fall and does not reach it's terminal velocity. (this is also ignoring the movement of the earth towards the massive object).

The empire state building is 381m tall, the object will be traveling at 86.4m/s by the time it hits the ground. 

**It will impact the ground with 4.6906*10^19 joules of energy, or 11,211 Megatons of TNT. This would be 224 time larger than Tsar-Bomba, the largest nuclear explosion ever. According to nukemap this is the size of the affected area: http://i.imgur.com/TDnfMGe.png**


I would need someone with more knowledge to calculate the energy released by that much neutron star material turning back into w/e matter it would turn back into since there is not enough gravitational pressure to maintain it's current state of matter.

cquh69o&buildapcforme&imanomeletteAMA&OP, I highly suggest this build rather than the /u/TheReelMVP's. /u/TheReelMVP's build uses a Mini ITX motherboard, which is tiny, meaning you won't be able to add another GPU in the future, should you so desire. You will also (almost) never need 16 gigabytes of RAM. Also, /u/TheReelMVP's build will give you a tiny computer. If you don't want such a small computer, choose this one, but this one does not contain any WiFi or Bluetooth, unlike the Gigabyte Mini ITX board above, so you'll either want to buy a USB network card or a PCI-E WiFi card. Also, if you want to save a bit of money, go with the i5-4690 as it'll give you roughly the same performance for cheaper.

If they go for it without any official agreement but it just so happens that they tend to propose things that the SNP are inclined to support, then Labour can claim full credit for getting stuff done, while also saying that they're demonstrating either the ability to keep the Scots in line or a broad-based appeal (depending on exactly who they're directing that message to), and the SNP can tell *their* supporters that it happened because they pulled the debate that way."

They were going to hold it for me until the weekend when I could drive down to sign the paperwork and pick it up. They called me a day later saying ""OOPS - The guy that traded in that car came back and took it away before it was officially ours to sell."" Nice.

They actually told the truth, but it was a huge fuck up in their part to try to sell me a car that wasn't officially theirs yet. I was ready to take my business elsewhere, but they offered me a deal on a newer model that turned out to be amazing, and I used their fuck up as leverage to throw in so much shit. I doubt that would have worked at a small dealership, but at least they sort of made up for it."

But it's, by analogy, the same as learning how to be a boxer. What's scarier?  
1. Going to a local town's boxing ring where classes are given, and lots of regulars go who can tell you all the ducking and diving moves  
or...  
2. Contacting someone via Craigslist.com, who says ""I'm an experienced boxer. Come round to my house tonight and I'll show you how I hit""

Well duhhhh. Sure, the boxing ring has got regulars. They might even be a little cliquey until you've been a couple of times, and get to know them. And they might know how to hit hard.  But they'll also know safety techniques, and you'll learn from all of them.

Whereas meeting this totally unknown guy at his house....? Whoa dude. You'd have to be both braver than me, and naive.

For sidewall repair, anything past the tops of the tread knobs on the edge, can't be reliably repaired, it can, but no shop will take the liability on that one. 

For chunks and holes, sure the hole can be patched, but with a chunk missing, things can get caught, the wire can be exposed, and poor ride can occur.

cquh6he&Planetside&Zeblasky&"Hard spawns are making bases extremely hard to defend. Just look at Freyr(Esamir north-west AMP station). I've never seen that base being defended at least for some time if attackers had 55% or more vs defenders. If anything, you can actually keep attacking this base even when you have 40% of local pop. Just move from one point to another. 

Hard spawns worked in PS1 because it was completely different game in so many areas(base design, vehicle power, distances between bases and towers, capture timer, etc). It wont work here, because towers were usually your stronghold for assaulting outer base perimeter and just a source of MAXes(because you could not get them with AMS in PS1). If strong resistance was present, you still needed 2-3 AMS close to base entry points in order to take it. But here you will just make every single base a freaking COD map.

Tl;dr: This goes completely against concept of defensible bases and will strongly favor attacking force. Also may make logistics even more obsolete."

My most recent measurements are 40"" 37"" 47"" 49"" 46"" and the calculator came up with 38GG, but I believe I was overestimated by a few cup sizes, assuming that a Cacique 38F is equivalent to a UK 38F. The next cup size up in Cacique is a G, and that's too big for me. I forgot to add in the post that I was confident in my size, and I really want to know how it would translate to the different brands that people on this sub wear. Like if a brand runs smaller or bigger in the cups than what I'm used to, or if it is meant for narrow or wide roots. I just don't want to order something that doesn't fit or is the wrong shape."

cquh6ib&Drugs&Parsnipel&"Weekend countryside with friends, plan on taking shrooms all together. Day before we were going to I drop acid. About an hour in my best friend asks me if he can have a hit. To share with his gf. ""Sure, here you go!""

A few hours in it's dark and we're all just hanging around, drinking. Someone brought a fatboy hammock. I got in it, but something didn't feel quite right. So I jump out and shout, ""nobody takes my fucking spot!"" I run upstairs to get my duvet, run downstairs, drop it in the hammock, run to the fridge, get a beer, look for my tobacco on the table and take it all back to the hammock.

So there I am.. everything is soft and warm. I have my beer. I'm smoking a smoke. And then a friend comes sitting next to me. ""You comfortable, yeah?"" she asks, almost sarcastically. ""Yeeaaah,"" I say in a stupid voice. We go way back and stuff like this makes her laugh all the time. ""But, could you swing me a little?"" So she starts pushing the hammock. It's swinging too hard and I ask her, ""softer."" Someone puts on Otis Redding and I'm softly humming while I get into this state of trance. It felt like forever.

Then she stops swinging to go get something. I snap out of it and notice something strange. ""Did I?"" ""Oh shit, I did.. fuck, I jizzed my pants""

Tl;dr: tripping on 250-300mcg of acid. In hammock, covered with a duvet, listening to Otis Redding while a friend gently swings the hammock. I jizzed my pants."

cquh6ki&funny&NotMyCircus&"Yes. Many episodes are frollicky and happy adventures, but many are dark and twisted and ugly in a brilliant kind of way. There are deep, eloquent emotions in the story archs, pain and exquisite joy in the Doctor's eyes, love and loyalty in the companions, and super killer robots and aliens along the way. The show has the perfect gimmick - a machine that can travel anywhere in time and anywhere in space, which basically means they can do whatever they want whenever they want. They travel to distant planets, to the end of the Universe, back to Victorian London, and even to the afterlife. It's super-natural, it's scientific-y, and it's raw and unashamedly-human... it's remarkable, and so are the characters you meet along the way, like Captain Jack Harkness and the companions.  

Give it a shot, it's hard to be bored with such a spectrum of adventures and stories. I'd suggest starting with the season where they rebooted the series with the 9th Doctor. The first episode almost turned me off, but the second one was breath-taking,  and hit me square in the feels. Plus I like aliens, and that episode is full of them.

 One thing to understand going in, The Doctor is not human. He is an alien, and when he dies a mortal death, he is regenerated into a new body but with a slightly different persona and a general, sometimes spotty, remembering of his previous incarnation. He is still him, The Doctor, the same guy, just... different. This is why you hear things like ""9th Doctor"" and ""I like 10 the best."" It's a neat idea that let's the show go on and on with new actors as the lead. Some are with us for 1 season, others are for 3 or 4. 

Enjoy! "

If we let those people who don't want jobs quit and live off their basic incomes, those jobs open up to be filled by those who really want jobs. This of course will obviously also improve productivity, as there's a big difference between the work of someone who hates their job, and the work of someone who likes their job.

However, that again is assuming you're right, and [I just don't think it's reflective of the way people would really react if they could](https://medium.com/basic-income/if-we-no-longer-force-people-to-work-to-meet-their-basic-needs-won-t-they-stop-working-3996442b7585)."

cquh6l3&rupaulsdragrace&meldolphin&"You know when there's this really popular movie that comes out and all your friends tell you to go see it?  So you go...and you don't like it.  You start questioning your friends' taste level but if the rest of the world loves it so much, you start wondering if there's something wrong with your thought process.  Maybe you watch the movie again to see what you missed out on.  Everyone talks about how great the visual effects were but you thought they were kind of cheesy and terrible, or they tell you about the great plot but you notice plotholes everywhere.

A couple months later you're hanging out with your friends and you feel brave enough to admit that you didn't like that movie.  Suddenly all your friends are talking about how much they hated it too and you wonder what the hell happened.

That was kind of my thought process.  I was never aboard the Pearl love-train but I mostly held my tongue because I figured there was something I just wasn't getting.  I wanted to give her a chance.  Now that people are less downvote-happy toward opinions that are negative about Pearl, people are more willing to come out and admit their feelings.

They don't think ""what do I reasonably expect to get out of this card and how much do I reasonably want it to do for me to be happy with it"". People don't understand that you should reasonably expect to only get 4-6 damage out out of a goblin guide and you opponent should draw about 1 card for him doing it. Its really up to you if that's actually worth it, and for many its not. I look at something like guttersnipe or zozu and I think OK I need to be getting at least 6 damage out of it because its a curve topping 3 drop. OK to get six damage I'm gonna have to cast him and get 3 triggers. Wow casting him is probably gonna take that whole turn, would suck if he insta jibed. OK so say he lives then what? 3 spells in one turn? Ugh OK maybe 2 and the. I'll dome them for 4 that OK right? But I mean after that surely they'll recognize him as a threat and kill him right? But I haven't got my 6 yet. So wow o have to untap with that guy twice to get what I want out of him? Geez that sounds bad. On the other hand arc lighting. 3 damage for 1 card is... OK for 3 mana? At sorcery? Gross. O but I can kill 2 or 3 guys? Or I can kill one and sebd the rest upstairs? O OK value. What are the pit falls? Pumps? Who plays pumps? Counter spells?

The best way I can recommend is a book. I still find them unmatched in terms of going through anything thoroughly.

cquh6ov&pics&McBridleCat&"Government officials will generally not want to partake in controversial, highly public cases. Any government official from X department will be seen as representative of *all* that department. It is thus generally frowned upon for government officials to get involved in stuff like this. If a government official *did* take a stance on this and advocated for it to go to trial, it would be seen as an unfair trial automatically. 

At any rate, people who best *understand* the problems with the case will generally be legal professionals, not government officials. And legal professionals *are*  working on this case. [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/feature/aclu-response-ferguson) is looking into it, as is [NAACP](http://www.naacp.org/pages/justice-for-michael-brown)

*edit* Anther way to think of *why* government officials won't get involved is because they might think ""That's not my job, that's not what I was elected to do."" They may also think ""That's not what my constituents want. This is just my personal view, but as a member of the American government I can't do things based on my personal desires."""

cquh6pr&AskReddit&mightysquirrell&"I had this dream often when I was a kid, then it stopped, but I had it again about 6 months ago, which was really odd

In the dream, I'm with my 4th grade teacher and class.  We're in the middle of a flat, endless desert - just dry, cracked, yellow dirt as far as you can see in every direction, sun beating down, no clouds in the sky. There is a wooden ship (sort of pirate ship style) that is in front of us, partially buried in the sand, old, weathered, no sails any more, just one mast still standing. Since we're on a class field trip, the teacher leads us up some stairs onto the ship, which has just an empty wooden deck, except there's a white stove in the middle and there's a big burly chef, muscular, with his sleeves rolled up and big hairy arms, a big cigar in his mouth, chef hat on and white dirty apron, red bandana around his neck, and a spatula in his hand. He's cooking something in a skillet, and the teacher and the rest of my class gather round to watch.  I stay back and look around, and that's when I see a knot hole in one of the deck boards.  I go up to the hole and I get down on my hands and knees and press my eye to the hole, and under the floor boards there's a skeleton staring back up at me.  I fill with panic and the dream ends."

cquh6s3&europe&weneedtofederalize&I fear you might be right. Danish exceptionalism is definitely thriving all over the country. Although regular Danes easily change opinions concerning the EU, they are also massively uninformed and quick to focus on negative sides while ignoring that 50%-66% of our laws (which work great) can be traced directly back to the EU. It does feel a bit utopian to imagine the population and our politicians suddenly becoming massively pro-Europe and maybe even federalist.

Next time you talk to him, mention it, but don't harp on it and don't answer all the questions that are sure to come. A whole lot of 'I don't know' and changing the subject.    
     
I have a mother and sister who are somewhat estranged and a stepmother. When I speak to my mother, she doesn't ask about me or my life, she wants to know what my sister is doing and she wants to know what my stepmother is doing. It's none of her business.

Atheism is not the claim that a god doesn't exist. Atheism is the rejection of a claim. All atheism says, is that ""I'm not convinced"". God doesn't exist and I'm not convinced are very different statements. 

You need to know this point inside and out. Period. Atheism is not a claim. Is is the rejection of one. And just because you're rejecting a claim, doesn't mean you're affirming the opposite claim. A rejection is a rejection, not a counter-claim. "

cquh6w1&AskReddit&NoChanceButWhoCares&"Senior year of hs, I was dating the salutatorian, and everyone hated the valedictorian so much, that because their GPA only differed in the ten thousandths place, our AP Lit teacher let my gf discretely take an optional final without letting the valedictorian know because my school had the ""If you take the AP test, you don't have to take a final in that class"" policy. So my gf took it after school the day before the last day of classes, it bumped her from an A- to an A, and made her the valedictorian. My ex was the most popular girl around for that summer because everyone fucking loved her for taking the valedictorian down a peg.


.....Now I'm dating the almost-valedictorian four years later."

cquh6we&gameofthrones&butt_slut_boi&"[The Wall/ADWD major spoilers](/s ""I can only assume you're talking about the Horn of Joramun. The thing is, in all the legends, it was used to 'Awaken giants from the earth' by Joramun during the fight against the Night's King. It makes no mention of The Wall whatsoever. It is possible that it doesn't mean literally wake giants up, but instead turn them to their primal instincts, like Wun Wun flipping out at Castle Black, or bind them to the will of whoever blows the horn, a similar legend to the dragon horn that Euron has. Many believe that breaking the Wall was just a rumor circulated by Mance Rayder to possibly frighten the Watch into letting the free folk pass through on peace terms.  Mance spent a very long time looking for the horn all over the place, going up into the Frostfangs and raiding giant graves. It ties into the theory that Mance wrote the pink letter, and is scheming his ass off in the north and preparing to strike on the realm, and the horn would give him the Giants. I think it's possible that the Wall will come down somehow, but I don't think that the Horn of Joramun will do it since there is no mention of that power in the lore surrounding it, but instead it's circulated by the Free Folk."")"

First of all, this is a systematic review of other studies and these things tend to be more prone to selection bias but we won't go too much into that. Anyways, in the article, it states: ""symptoms typically occur within a few days from drug discontinuation and last a few weeks"" which agrees with what I said about throwing your brain out of whack for a little while. The conclusion was that SSRIs can cause discontinuation problems which is true. That is not the same as causing depression. 

I don't know if you're able to see the article since most people can't unless they have a paid subscription or work in healthcare but it states later on in the article that the discontinuation symptoms were mostly caused in patients who discontinued abruptly. This also agrees with what I mentioned earlier about tapering off the medication. Yes, it's still possible to have side effects with tapering but far less likely. Additionally, we have to look at what they consider to be a symptom of ""discontinuation syndrome."" In the article, it states things like fatigue, headache, diarrhea, etc. This is VERY different from discontinuation of SSRIs will cause depression. 


If you want, I can download the full article and send it to you. Let me know if there's some way I can help. Unfortunately, I know very little about CBT other than to recommend them but I have doctor friends to bug if you have any questions."

cquh6zt&Boxing&Rythiz&"Unanimous decision for Floyd Mayweather.

Pacquiao will try to make the fight exciting in the first few rounds and he'll win the first four rounds. After that, Floyd adjusts and lands perfect counters and avoids the machine gun of punches by Pacquiao. Pacquiao will land a hard left in Round 10 and Mayweather will be buckled, but he'll come back strong, but the judges give Pacquiao the win for Round 10. Floyd will then pick Pacquiao apart for the rest of the fight while he throws a lot of punches throughout the rest of the fight, tiring him out by the end.

After the fight, Floyd will then act all humble and say, ""It's been a long road. And I proved to the world that I can beat one of the biggest Hall of Famers and boxer. Manny Pacquiao is a great fighter, but Floyd Mayweather's a better fighter. I want to thank all the fans, the Money Team, Team Pacquiao, and everybody else who made this happen.""

Mark has a low cooldown, but I'll happily bet that you don't end up using the Dash half of the spell that much more often than other summoners (expect perhaps Flash). Between the shots you miss and the shots that would end up getting you killed, there aren't that many good opportunities to follow up on casting a Mark. Maybe you could argue that the cooldown should be 25s or 30s instead of 20s but I really doubt that a few seconds makes the difference between balanced and ""incredibly oppressive."" "

cquh70j&NoStupidQuestions&Taph&"One of the ways that people who are deaf and blind communicate is through a modified form of sign language. [Helen Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller), for example, would have an interpreter sign into her palm with their fingers. She became both deaf and blind at the age of 19 months and one of her teachers was finally able to teach her to communicate by doing this. For instance, her teacher would sign ""water"" into one of Keller's hands while running water over the other and Keller eventually put the two ideas together. I would assume some variation on the method is still used."

Me and my boyfriend were best friends, it took him the whole school year to work up the courage to tell me and it didn't go so well the first time, but we were still best friends. You could always tell her ""I like you, but if you don't feel the same way I understand. I just thought I should tell you."" Maybe she'll feel the same and maybe she won't. I was always the kind of person who said ""thanks for telling me that. I'm sorry I don't feel the same."" and we would continue on being friends acting like nothing happened.

cquh75i&pathofexile&meripor2&"Ill add my feedback from leveling as a witch to mid cruel so far.

**Normal**
This felt significantly more challenging than on live, partially because of the lack of skill gems available (although I'd assume this will be fixed later). The only gem I had was tendrils and a fire trap, leveling was slow and painful until lvl 28 when you get better gems. The damage of mobs seemed to have been significantly increased and rares were especially hard to kill. The brutus fight in particular felt overtuned.

**Cruel so far**
This feels far far easier than normal. Mobs seem to tickle me and I haven't even come close to a death yet (as opposed to several deaths in normal). This could be because I have better gear than in normal but it really does feel like I've gone down in difficulty not up.

edit: Just got to Act 4 and the difficulty seems to have ramped up significantly. Cruel dominus was a cake walk and then I almost died to a rare in the dried lake in Act 4.

**Zone progression**
Im a big fan of most of the changes, they seem to have streamlined alot of the progression and there is less repetition of zones to reach adequate levels. My criticism is currently I feel Act 3 is too long, its the most tedious of the Acts and it seems to last far longer. I'd probably remove some of the sewer levels and maybe lower sceptre of God. I also feel like the prison in Act 1 doesn't need to be two zones, its quite a frustrating layout and having to go through it twice is annoying."

cquh772&CombatFootage&Khanbalyk&"I don't want to be a negative nelly, but the P-39 Aircobra was a piece of shit.  It was designed around two things: a big ass supercharger, and the 37mm cannon.

They added the cannon, but skipped the supercharger.  As a result, the aircraft was woefully underpowered, and the mid-engine design made it prone to snap rolls, among other undesirable handling characteristics.

We flew them in the ""lol whatever"" Southeast Asian theater of the war, in support of McArthur's (wildly successful but largely unappreciated) campaign there, but anywhere the fighting was thick, you weren't going to find an Aircobra.  Did I mention that egress from the cockpit involved an annoying little side door over the wing?  Good luck bailing out!

So, what did we do with these terrible little planes?  Naturally, we shipped them to the Russians.  Russian pilots, being inherently replaceable and consequently incredibly morbid, pushed the planes to their limits and learned via hard knocks what they could (and could not) do.  Ultimately, they employed them with admirable effectiveness against ground targets.  Of course, a seasoned German pilot in a Bf-109 or FW-190 could take down a P-39 by looking at it sternly.

Later in the war, they added the supercharger, called it the P-63 King Cobra, and it was a decent aircraft, but by then we were fully invested in the P-51 and P-47, both of which performed their tasks very well.

A terrific book about a P-37 pilot in the middle of nowhere is [Angels Twenty](http://www.amazon.com/Angels-Twenty-Young-American-Flier/dp/0075821257).

cquh7bb&leagueoflegends&Anderscone&"Server: NA

Type of Bug: In-Game Bug

Description: Elise can no longer self-cast rappel 

Steps to reproduce: Go into any game mode. Try to cast rappel (not onto a target) via self-cast.

Expected result: Elise rappels

Observed result: Elise does nothing

Reproduction rate: 100%

System specs: HP laptop. 


Elise can still do a target-less rappel if she clicks E with your mouse cursor within the range indicator. If she clicks outside of that circle, she will walk to the edge of the range and then cast it. It is extremely clunky to use this way and also GREATLY increases the chance of accidentally rappeling onto a minion or enemy when using the ability during cluttered teamfight situations. To avoid this I've always self-casted my rappel if I didn't want to immediately drop on a target. Now the self-cast does nothing. IMO this is a pretty big bug that makes playing her extremely clunky.

The trial stage failed to prove that their product is non-inferior to the leading competitor based on specific criteria, although ""a subset of patients showed evidence of non-inferiority"".  They'll try to leverage this partial success to change the criteria and start a new trial, so success isn't out of the question.

cquh7e7&uwaterloo&PPewt&"My personal approach to scheduling has been:

* 4 courses  
* Part-time job with (semi-)fixed hours  
* Tutoring  
* Clubs/volunteering/etc

I enjoy the extra money, as it ensures I can stay debt-free while also having a fair amount of disposable income to blow on things which I want to do (such as eating out with friends frequently). Just find something that works for you.

As for financial problems, you should be able to sustain yourself off of just co-op sooner or later, but if you want extra spending money or just something different to do a part-time job is nice. That being said, if you're going to go for a part-time job, you should probably be at least a bit choosey (taking anything less than ~$20/h is probably not worth the stress unless you have lots of free time or really like the job). Anyhow, it's ultimately up to whatever you find works for you."

By that time, the cheaters have already created new accounts (and probably been banned on them, too), and the multiplayer community has moved on to other newer games, and if they do cheat again, they will be banned again, so really the only people still being affected by the ban are the innocent ones who got flagged with false positives.

It's true that people used it to refer to gangsters, but it was generally Anglo-Saxon people referring to Slavs, Jews, and Italians, who weren't really considered white at the time.

I guess you can argue that it's more of a classist thing, since people mostly use it to refer to uneducated people who don't have social graces, but I think it's racist too."

Having a kid isn't the end of your life like many people are so inclined to believe. Just because she had a kid that early doesn't stop her from being who she wants to be.  

The reason I said good for her is because she stepped up to the plate and took responsibility for her actions. She didn't just abort it or give it off to whatever family would take it. "

cquh7ik&news&yew_anchor&"That has been speculated, but not proven, nor do we understand why we see this result. It would be necessary to examine the following possibilities to understand what's really happening. 

1) Men are more likely to engage in negotiation throughout their lives and are therefor more successful at it. Alternatively, women may do it less and therefore be less skilled. This may be for social and/or biological reasons and therefore not something that can really be fixed. 

2) The women who do tend to negotiate more are the same women who have more abrasive personalities that do rub others the wrong way. This is not noticed in men because more men in general tend to negotiate so there is less of a perception of men collectively being seen as abrasive when negotiating.  

3) The way in which women tend to negotiate as an outcome of biological differences is less effective in this regard than the way in which men tend to negotiate. 

4) Women aren't perceived any differently but just negotiate less as group. Women tend to report higher job satisfaction than men so men negotiating more than women may simply be a reflection of their dissatisfaction. "

Of the subjects interviewed, none appear to be actual sex workers - even the individuals interviewed via police stings were johns, caught via reverse stings involving female police officers. A brief review of the articles referenced found similar things: Chapkis 2003 focused solely on prostitutes believed to be trafficked; Farley 2003 is the paper I've already criticized, which used solely street prostitutes in crime- and drug-heavy areas as informants for its US and Canada samples.

Of course you will see negative results if you choose to interview the subjects in the most desperate of circumstances. And while I certainly think that we as a society have a responsibility to protect individuals in these circumstances, the data I've already pointed to suggests that these circumstances are typical only of a small minority of sex workers. If you're going to make the suggestions you have about sex workers - suggestions which no sex worker I know would agree with - you need to either demonstrate that this data is actually a representative sample (which, per the articles I posted, doesn't seem to be the case); or show that these findings apply to the majority of sex workers not in the sample.

I'm sorry, but I remain monumentally unconvinced."

Do you think it might have been the SRX you were referring to? both the CTS and SRX had similar NAV systems, however the SRX's was a newer generation that supported BT audio. 

The CTS's navigation hardware was never revised during the production span.

The funny thing about the SRX Bluetooth implementation is that it used 2 separate radios: One for audio (through the NAV) and one for calls (through OnStar) and you couldn't have a phone paired to both at the same time.

In reality there's 2 options if you wanted Bluetooth audio in the car: You could either purchase a bluetooh audio receiver and plug it into the headphone jack in the console, OR purchase an aftermarket controller that replaces the GM nav system."

cquh7pl&Cynicalbrit&Klynn7&"It is a strawman because I said one thing and you're implying it means another thing, which it doesn't.  My reasoning does *not* imply the other suggestions you made.

You talk about informed opinions, and I already said they're allowed to have an opinion, but in my opinion they're not really allowed a vote (or their vote is worth much less than the people actually doing the work).  Similarly someone who watches a lot of football is allowed to have an opinion on what play a team should make, but at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what that opinion is.

I do not think things should be free because they've always been free and I don't want to pay for them is a valid opinion, especially from someone who isn't putting the work into these free things.  That's entitlement.  Almost definitionally.  Total Biscuit himself (the anti E-word king) said just as much.  If you think someone you want should be free just because it has been before, you're saying you're entitled to that thing, which is plainly false in this case.

You cite Economics 101, which as is typically the case when someone says ""Economics 101"" is greatly oversimplifying the situation.  Perhaps that hit counters put the idea on someone's radar, but I guarantee the business decision to enact this system was far more complicated and nuanced than ""well, these download numbers are great!  Just *imagine* if we put a $ on the front of them!""

Also you refer to their ""exorbitantly high cut"" as a lot of people who are not actually content creators tend to do.  Have you heard a single modder actually complain about this split?  I haven't.  That whole point of contention is protectionism at best (""but we have to protect the poor modders from being abused by Valvthesda!"") or making something out of nothing at worst (""I don't want to pay for mods, and I *especially* don't want to pay a greedy corporation for them!"")"

* There are also lots of examples of technology being used to do shitty stuff (wars, hacking, inequality,etc)

There are people who are still not convinced that black, brown, and poor people are treated differently by the police and are routinely beaten, killed, and victimized by police in a police by numbers system and the war on drugs. Slowly phone cameras and the protesting that ensues following police murder on camera are convincing middle class and rich white people that there is a problem. There are some who will never be convinced because they either benefit financially from the current setup or they are just evil and like people being brutalized, murdered, and caged like animals for the color of their skin, their economic status, or even for victimless ""crimes"".

cquh7t0&todayilearned&captainAwesomePants&"You're joking, but as a parent let me tell you, Hero of the Rails is DARK. Let me tell you about this movie.

Our protagonist, Thomas the Tank Engine, discovers a broken down old train. The train broke decades ago, and nobody ever found him, so he just had to sit there, exposed to rain and snow and animals and whatever else, for decades. He never died, though, being a train. He just sat there, bored.

Thomas excitedly promises to go and fetch help, but Hiro (that's the train's name) stops him. Hiro is worried that, being useful, the human controllers would decide to simply kill him and melt him down for scrap. Thomas agrees that this is a perfectly reasonable concern, and instead vows to secretly deliver parts and fixes to him over time, so that they can hopefully one day introduce him as a useful engine and hopefully not get him killed.

Thomas begins secretly delivering parts to Hiro, but this slows down his own productivity, risking becoming no longer useful himself and facing a similar fate. Eventually, the controller and some Benedict Arnold train suspect Thomas's activities and, under questioning, Thomas explains about Hiro.

Hiro is returned to the station where the controller recognizes him as the titular Hero of the Rails, the most useful train of his day. He promises not to scrap Hiro, since Hiro was once very, very useful, and he believes that it would be a net win to fix him instead of scrap him.  The trains all celebrate.


I am not kidding. That is the plot. In the sequel, the dirty coal trains learn that they must be happy with their shitty coal train quarters because they should be satisfied with their station in life and not try to be like their steam train betters."

I'm not entirely comfortable with rolling the dice on Bradford's health myself, but I'd prefer that than what we were gonna give up for MM. If Bradford implodes and we get Sanchize all year next year at least we'll still have a (high) first rounder to try and get another QB. Or, Bradford stays healthy and we keep our good players. I'm good with it.

Second consideration would be template metaprogramming in c++ vs generics and reflection in java, though you might not end up doing anything complicated in either. As I said they're not that different, but we can't give suggestions without requirements.

cquh7y1&SandersForPresident&DonDigglesworth&"Thank you for your reply. I have some searching and learning to do definitely. I voted R for presidents because it was always a question of who is going to keep my taxes lower. I doubt I have anywhere near the monies that makes tax policy really matter. I am in my low 30's. I am from Texas so it was Bush for the first 2 elections and a vote for McCain then screw voting during the last cycle. 

Let me try and sum up what I think I am and see if you might believe it is worth investigating further into Sanders.

I am pro-Choice

I am for reasonable gun control measures - waiting periods

I am for legalization of medicinal and recreational marijuana

I am against wars but at the same time for the US being the major military superpower - I was a ""blow them all up"" person when 9/11 happened

Do you care to expand on your thoughts regarding international cooperation? I have seen how much US foreign policy can sway some government and citizen views but for the most part I am lucky that many locals judge based on the person rather than the country tag. I believe that the US is a wonderful country and many non-US citizens I meet dream of going there even if just for a visit. We, US, have had a hard time the past many years and the small bit of Sanders I have seen on Reddit does seem intriguing as it does seem that he is for pushing the current system out of politics and is hoping to pave a way for politicians running on their beliefs and not faltering into what we have had for basically the last 15 years. Even if I don't 100% believe in his platform I do believe that a change needs to be made greater than the D or R party I have experienced being in control.

cquh7yw&leagueoflegends&avidcritic&"I've been the person to shut down all the Yusui jerking because it seems really unwarranted, but.... 

Think about it critically. C9 may not really want the ""better skilled"" player. ~~Sneaky said on stream that they really want the mid to be the shotcaller and really replace not only the mid, but Hai's role on the team~~. Personally, I'd imagine Incarnati0n would have a better understanding of macro-style gameplay, given his time coaching on SK, but who knows. This year has taught us that it's better to play with players you're comfortable with and prioritize team cohesion, instead of talent stacking. See EL and OMG  

EDIT: Alright boys. I watched ~ 4 hours of Sneaky's vods from the past 5 nights (at one point I was listening to 3 different vods to be more efficient) and couldn't find the specific instance I was referencing. Other people agree with me in the fact that it was talked about, but there are some discrepancies among his exact wording. I'm going to donate to his stream to ask him tonight and he will hopefully answer. If someone can go back and find the past instance he mentioned that I'm looking for, I will donate $4.20 to you on Paypal. Otherwise, suck muh balllz  

EDIT 2: Here's my cropped [screen shot](http://gyazo.com/c62115c784b079c3b1c88df4c3a7ed5d) from my Paypal of donating to Sneaky. Stay tuned into his stream tonight because he will address it later most likely. 

EDIT 3: **He Answered boys**. I'm not going to quote him until the VOD is out, but I'll give the gist. They are looking for someone who will be able to cooperate and work well with the team. They definitely aren't looking for a shotcaller and said they will most likely have to assign it to one person later. Furthermore he said that no one could fill Hai's shoes because it would be too much to ask for. 

EDIT 4: Final edit, bitches. [Here's his answer from the vod.](http://www.twitch.tv/c9sneaky/v/4556837?t=253m47s) Text portion for whoever cares: “We’re definitely not looking for the mid laner to shot call. I think what we’re looking for is just a player who is just good at the game, confident in their play, and can work well with the team. I think the shot calling thing is just something we will have to appoint to someone after we found out an extra teammate and I don’t think anyone can fill that role that Hai did. So asking for that in addition to being a good player is just way too much I think.”  

Also, shoutout to Idopefish(?) who [said he will eat his penis](http://www.twitch.tv/c9sneaky/v/4556837?t=262m29s) if they take Poebelter over Incarnati0n."

These types who give a fuck what others do in their own lives to be true to themselves are typically not happy themselves, are seeking to project their own unhappiness, and, chances are, have a tinge of 'homo-panic' because, for whatever fucking reason, even if it was a post op, gorgeous transexual, men will still get all fucking odd when an attractive transexual is seen because they assume to be attracted to them makes them 'gay.'  Hardly.  You're more gay getting a boner over a gruff woman with some lip hair than an attractive transexual.

Hell, as a straight woman, if I found out my boyfriend was born a woman, I'd give zero fucks; he looks like a man, IS a man, and takes care of his own life and treats me supremely well.  Sadly, it seems some people care more about sexual minutiae than love or a relationship.

Personally I think our societal issue has LESS to do with former Olympic Stars becoming women and more to do with our lack of empathy for our fellow humans, thanks in part to the EXTREMELY impersonal aspect of internet communication.

But I have bad feelings about Persona 5 and even don't know why. Maybe it's all about style, main character or three second role characters which look too typical.

With that said, there could be patches available through Windows Update by the time it becomes available to the public.

1) In about a day or two, Gaijin's going to throw up their hands and say, ""Whoops. Our bad. Rockets totally overperforming. Let's fix that right now."" They fix it, Calliope becomes relatively balanced because it can't wtfpwn Maus anymore but still wrecks soft targets like it's supposed to, or it gets a BR/Tier increase. A bunch of people who dropped $50 complain. Gaijin responds, ""Vehicle was overperforming, no refunds."" Of course, Gaijin's totally aware the rockets are overperforming, which is a selling point of the tank (even if it's not advertised). So people pay $50 for a couple days' clubbing and we get to make fun of them for being skill-less wallet warriors for eternity.

2) Gaijin makes up some BS reason for the Calliope to be as accurate and deadly as it is, Calliope continues to overperform, MRLS tanks become FOTM. If MRLS vehicles continue to be released as premiums, GF becomes a ghost town because no one wants to play p2w War Thunder except the people winning.

We got to talking and he says, ""This district is going downhill. It's all of these blacks.""

I pause for a minute. This man is Sicilian. I'm white, so I'm guessing he thought that meant I'm automatically of the same opinion.

A black student walks up and asks some things; this kid must have heard some of the conversation. Mr. C answers him. The kid has just turned away and he says to me, ""He's OK for being one of them.""

In my country (Portugal) there is a consensus, he was the best of that era, we all liked Figo (one of is rivals in that time) butt Zidane was a lot better.

Di Stefano was the king in the 50's, Pele in the 60's, Cruijff in the 70's, Maradona in the 80's, Zidane in the late 90's early 00's and Messi since then.

Ronaldo Fenomeno was closed, and arguably better than Zizou in top form butt he had to many injuries and only as something like 3, 4 years in his prime (when he was in his early 20's). Zizou had a decade in contention to the best player in the world.

One of the most skillful players ever (his first touch was unreal) who won every important thing like CL, WC, La Liga and Seria A (the best league in the world by far in that time). 

For me he is the best I ever seen apart from Messi and this comes from a Portuguese a country Zizou used to kill in the big tournaments."

cquh876&gaming&Pseudoboss11&"Considering that there are thousands of people who do happen to make a living off of content creation, [some webcomics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_professional_webcomic_artists), [Youtubers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_YouTube_personalities), game developers and musicians who make their money off of the internet. So their professions are not completely unfeasable as employment. Difficult? Sure. Reliable? Definitely not. But not invalid.

Not to mention the enormous number of people who suppliment their earnings with content they've created. That number is enormous, and are the people who are probably most harmed by those who crop off comic names. They're not as recognizable as XKCD and are less likely to have someone identify it.

Then there's the fact that maybe I find the comic funny and want to find more like it, that's the whole essence of a subreddit, to find content that relates to me. I like that style, I want to find more like it, removing a name means that i'm at the whim of the content aggregator. . . Which is exactly what the aggregator wants.

What makes contextless creative work superior to creative work with a comic name under it? What is gained by name removal/ 

If names are so meaningless, why should we go through the effort of photoshopping them out?

Doesn't Reddit itself, which uses a karma system to rate contributors demonstrate that the Internet is NOT ""a world of anonymity where names are easily taken and easily discarded and inherently meaningless""? People want to know who's talking, and want to find out more about the people they find interesting. "

cquh881&speedrun&Bashfluff&"No. Marvel movies aren't dumb movies with explosions and mumbo jumbo. There's something more to it. If that's all we wanted, we could watch Transformers. It's a melding of several separate things.

GDQ's are meant to be in that same vein. So, if you're complaining that they're doing things wrong on the speedrunning end, those complaints are valid. How many of those WOULD lead to them losing money if they fixed it?

It seems to be that the overzealous rules policies and the occasionally unprofessional behavior of the staff, coupled with poor organization and communication make up the brunt of the complaints, and I'm sorry, if you think that is going to lose you money, you're off in the head.

I would say that these people don't think that, but that they don't care. If you're okay with that, fine. Keep watching and support them. If you're not, say something. Doing that is the only way to change things."

cquh89f&asktransgender&Melody_Prisca&"Well one of the studies I linked suggests that it is not a piss poor anti-androgen.

http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM197404182901602
""Mean (± S.E.M.) plasma testosterone — 416 ± 34 ng per 100 ml — was significantly lower in this group than that in the control-group mean — 742 ± 29 ng per 100 ml — for age-matched men who had never used marihuana""

That is a significant reduction, and it was seen in humans. Also it is thought to interfere with androgen uptake as well.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6249575

I don't see it really being a weak anti-androgen. Perhaps weaker than others, but it still has a significant effect. And as I said before I was never suggesting it could be the cause. Rather could it be one of the influencing factors.

Essentially what this means is that he's taking the integral of sec(x)/cos(x) (finding the area underneath the curve of sec(x)/cos(x)). He then proves that the area under sec(x)/cos(x) is equal to that of sec^(2)(x) and solves using an identity to say that the indefinite area under the curve is equal to tan(x) + c (where c is any real number)."

cquh8bb&geopolitics&protonbeam&"Hello, physicist here. I'm not sure if this is on your radar at all, but something interesting has been happening in my field (high energy particle physics) regarding China. Some background:

In the last couple of years China has been exploring the option of building the next proton-proton supercollider. This would be the successor to the Large Hadron Collider now operating in Switzerland, but with a diameter of ~100 km, to start up in the year ~2040, which is a standard planning timeline for such large projects. Money is apparently hardly an issue, which is very refreshing considering tightening science budgets in Europe and the USA. I imagine the prestige of being a leader in such a fundamental scientific field is appealing. They are apparently more worried about whether they can do it and if the western scientific communities would support them, but Chinese physicists are emboldened by the success of Daya Bay (nuclear reactor experiment where Chinese physicists beat the world to a difficult neutrino measurement). In the last year there have been almost continuous workshops in China (with western physicists) to work out a proposal to submit to the Chinese funding agencies, and hopefully we'll learn in ~ 1/2 - 1 years whether China will pursue this further. This would have huge implications for Physics.

Now, in the macroeconomic scheme of things, this ~$50bn project is obviously negligible. However, such a large project would necessarily have to be conducted as an international collaboration (even if China foots the lion's share of the bill), with a large fraction of participating scientists and engineers being from outside of China. Specifically for example, such a large collaboration categorically could not operate behind the internet firewall.

Do you think a project like this could serve as a catalyst for changing some of China's policies regarding censorship, openness, etc? How would the leadership respond to a 'westernization' of their academic scene?

Thank you.

cquh8cd&gallifrey&notwherebutwhen&"I don't think that the post Deadly Assassin Masters necessarily needed to have the same chemistry that Delgado and Pertwee had. In that serial the Master went way above and beyond ""I just want to prove my superiority over you"" and essentially tried to kill the Doctor in earnest. And by Planet of Fire the Doctor let the Ainley Master die. I am pretty sure that would destroy the more friendly aspects of anyone's relationship. 

The Time War (at least events leading up to it) changed all of this when the Master was given a new set of regenerations. No longer under the fear of permanent death the MacQueen Master somewhat resumes his pattern of trying to entice Doctor to combat his schemes in a more frenemy capacity. However these schemes are far more dangerous and deadly than they ever were and the Doctor rightfully hasn't forgotten the whole you tried to steal my body/regenerations bit.

It is post Time War that the Doctor himself is on the same wavelength essentially okay with the two of them resetting their relationship (telling the Simm Master they can fight across the stars as long as they don't fight on Earth). Essentially Gomez's Missy promised the Doctor just that with the legion of the dead Cybermen. She tried to leverage him back into frenemy territory. Time will tell though if the Doctor will truly respond in kind (the ""you win"" makes me think he will).

Personally I would enjoy seeing that Pertwee/Delgado kind of chemistry again and definitely think that the story is in the right place for it again. I also feel like Capaldi and Gomez could achieve that chemistry given the right plots and arcs."

cquh8cu&videos&winrarpants&"Because you speeding does not directly result in a crash statistically.  Its hard to directly say that the act of going over the speed limit is what causes the crashes.

The US DOT did a study on data between 2005 and 2007 that found 8.4% of all crashes were because the driver was driving ""too fast for conditions"", and another 4.9% were ""too fast for curve"". (http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/us-crashcause.pdf)  Neither of which can be considered outright speeding, so the percentage of crashes due to simply going over the speed limit is even below that (a virginia study found it to be about 2.9% in their state - http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/va-crash07.pdf).  

Now one could say, ""Well its more than 0% so its worth enforcing a speed limit.""  And I agree that there needs to be some sort of limit, but it needs to be a speed which is correct for the road.  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, would you not say the speed limit is too slow for the road?  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, that means 10% isnt which is really the majority cause of these speed related crashes, difference of speed of those involved.  So if the majority of traffic is going over the speed limit, do we limit the majority of people and continue to write tickets to those who dont obey, or do we raise the speed limit to prevent drivers from going slower than the pack?  Well we continue to write tickets of course because its a great source of income for police departments! /s"

cquh8ee&atheism&[deleted]&"It's very easy to show that Christianity makes no sense.

The narrative is that God required the death of an innocent person before he'd forgive everyone. Why? What use does a god have with a corpse? Okay, so we killed someone. Now sins are forgiven? How do those two things logically follow? Why does seeing a heart stop beating satiate god?

And if it's a just god, how does it make sense that he'd demand an innocent person get punished for shit he didn't do? Punishing an innocent person is pretty much the *opposite* of justice.

Some say, ""Jesus volunteered for it."" Okay, so what? It still doesn't make sense that God required it in the first place. Secondly, if somebody murdered your family and got away never to be caught, and your innocent neighbor said, ""since you want justice done, I will volunteer to go to prison in the killer's place,"" would you accept that and call it justice? Of course not, that makes no sense.

Some say, ""you're right, it's not justice. It's God's grace that he forgives us."" If that's the case, then why did there need to be a sacrifice, if it's not for justice's sake?

Some say, ""death is the debt owed for sin, it's like god paying off our mortgage."" In this scenario, god would be the one the mortgage is owed *to,* in which case he could just waive it. If somebody owes you money, and you want to forgive the debt, you just waive it, you don't need to go through the actions of driving to your bank, withdrawing the money, driving around the block and going back into the bank and depositing it back in, and say, ""there, I paid your debt to me off."" That makes no sense to go through those motions when the end result is the same. So why would God have to go through the motions of having himself killed in order to pay himself the debt owed to him by other people? And there's still the above problem about what use God has with death anyway - why is that a form of payment he requires/accepts?

Add in the fact that the person sacrificed was a human avatar of God himself, so it's essentially god sending himself to earth to sacrifice himself to himself, and that the ""sacrifice"" was more looks a three-day coma... The entire thing just makes no sense.

Even in /r/debatereligion, /r/Christianity, and /r/debateachristian, they can't make any sense of it, the answers are generally, ""that's just how it is, death was needed, end of story."" They just sweep something like that that makes no sense under the rug and chalk it up to God's mysteriousness like that. Somebody saying to trust that their story makes sense despite not being able to make sense of it is the hallmark of a scam.

Go ahead, post this in there. They won't give you any answers that actually make sense of it. I guarantee, ""That's just how it is, it's beyond our understanding"" will be the essence of whatever answers they give you."

cquh8fl&golf&jeckylee&"Thanks OP for this! Beginner who has finished 4 classes, learned putting and hitting, and several questions about moving forward.

1. Private coach is too expensive for me, I'm thinking taking the same group class again (only 2 or 3 people anyway), what should I focus on learning next?

2. I don't have my own clubs yet. Should I buy now? I like golf and want to spend a lot time honing putting/hitting and potentially chipping before going on 9/18 holes, do I still need a whole set now? Or only a few clubs will do?

3. Related to Q2, until reaching what level one can try easy course with 9 holes without being perceived as inappropriate by others? Just don't want people behind me get too pissed off, or hit ball to other people. 

EDIT:
4. Another question, my wife started learning together with me. She's not that into it and patient, but apparently she enjoys hitting the ball (well who doesn't). My instructor said we need to buy standard size clubs each, but if I got a iron set, can she use the shorter ones to just go hitting on range with me? Well this might be worth mentioning, but she's shorter and very lack in strengh. "

cquh8fv&Anarcho_Capitalism&Lacanfoucault&I don't want to reengineer the entire world, that's why I'm an anarcho-capitalist and support, wait for it, voluntary separation. Quit it with the strawmen. As for subjectivism, if we are pure subjectivists, nihilists, existentialists, etc., then our desired worldview is just as valid -- especially if established by voluntary means. There will be a co-incidence of wants; supply and demand. As for stability, stability should be assured over particular geographic areas if the community desires such through voluntary means; this could come by way of voluntary welfare-for-all of the ingroup and none for the outgroup if they are not productive or conducive to assimilation, or if they are a threat to long term demography (think mass immigration). Such would incentivize living while still protecting the potential contributions of foreigners. If you are someone from India or Africa who wants to work in high-skilled fields, and supports nuclear families, you would be welcome. The number of such individuals is limited, though, and the community should ensure the high quality of not only the immigrants but also of themselves; mass immigration defeats both goals. Crude Libertarians have a notion of magical immigrants often; environment matters -- lets achieve those conditions most amenable to achievement and happiness.

Say you end up listing the room for $220, if you aren't getting any requests after a month or so, lower the price.  If you're getting flooded with requests, you know you've undervalued yourself and bump up the price.  Also, keep in mind peak traveling seasons for NYC and change your prices accordingly.

EDIT: [Here](http://www.clinchem.org/content/59/3/478.short), [here](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/adb/27/3/854/), [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457512002709), [here](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13181-014-0393-4#page-1) and [here](http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e536.abstract). It's just from a quick scholar search, so I'm struggling to find the full articles, sorry, mostly abstracts. But there's plenty of research out there, and the consensus is pretty clear. 

Anyway, regardless of what the studies say, you'd have to be an idiot to think that being high isn't going to affect your driving. You know that it reduces reaction speed, reduces the ability to multi-task and affects cognitive reasoning. These are all reasons that people smoke in the first place, it's great to chill out on. You don't want to be super chill when driving, you want to be alert, aware and relaxed. "

cquh8ia&dotamasterrace&Bit-Bi-Bit&Depends on how ok you are with interacting with other players. If you do it all yourself, it will likely take you a few months or more. However if you choose to involve other players you can reasonably get them all in like 5 hours. It depends mainly on logistics like are people trading what you want to buy and does the reddit armory have what you want in stock. And if you decide to buy them off the steam market it's probably something like 30 minutes since theres a lot of clicking involved. But as I said earlier, the stock weapons you start with are head and shoulders above most of the alternative weapons.

If you already feel big reservations about the purchase before making it, I don't think they will go away once you buy it, unless the money is nothing to you and you're okay turning around and ordering something else right after because something broke or just looks bad. If you feel locked in to one option, in my opinion that's a good reason just to defer the purchase. There are so many quality keyboards in non-gaming brands that just don't have the RGB feature.

cquh8jm&AskReddit&barristonsmellme&"At no point has anyone suggested you stop tipping. The staff won't be punished by it in the slightest. They just get to live happily like every other member of waitstaff world wide in the knowledge that they have a base pay, that when they go the extra mile, the reward isn't just to help add upto their wage but is the bonus it's meant to be, and if the bonuses don't come then they are atleast still on minimum wage. 

A million people can have a million arguments on the matter but nt one single argument will top the ""Pay your bloody staff their wage!"" one. 

Do not for a second think that the world thinks the problem is that American wait staff get tipped. Everyone get's tipped.

The problem arises in the fact that those tips have to subsidize their wage. that they are not being paid by their manager the bare minimum pay. That when people think ""Oh that was good service, they'll get a tip"" that it's just expected because where else will they get *their wage* from.

People will not stop tipping servers. But how can they possibly be content in tipping knowing that they're paying the servers what they should already be getting paid anyway? 

It's absolutely disgusting. 

Think of any minimum wage job. 

You do the work, you get the hourly rate which is low enough as it is.

Now imagine you only get paid a fraction of that and have to rely on other people to pay you your wage. That is not how it works!


there is no socio-economic agenda behind what I'm saying. There is no grand idea or movement i'm trying to start. this is not a rallying call to maybe implement a new system. It's just the argument that bosses should pay their staffs wage, not the generosity of others. "
cquh8jn&dogs&Teemo4evr&"I'd just let him correct her. I have a 6 year old, almost 50 lb Standard Poodle, and a Mini Schnauzer/Boston Terrier mix puppy. When I brought the puppy home he was 8 weeks old and weighed 7 lbs. He is now 16 weeks and weighs 13ish lbs. I have let my poodle correct my puppy to his heart's content the whole time. 

Your puppy will eventually be a full grown dog, and preventing your older dog from laying the ground work for doggy respect will lead to fights down the road. The last thing you want is an older puppy or full grown dog with no respect and no manners, because this will lead to real fights and discontent down the road, which will be much harder for you to sort through and deal with than allowing your older dog to correct your pup now. As long as he is not drawing blood or being overly aggressive, I'd let the corrective growls, body posture, and snaps happen. "

I like that there's a place specifically reserved for it, though, despite the fact that it doesn't encompass all of the fat-shaming sentiment to be found on reddit. That there are people that find fat physically disgusting, and gluttony reprehensible, comes as no surprise to anyone, I'm sure.

There are, in fact, a number of overweight people in my life. Many family members are obese, even. It's possible I suppose that some of them are unaware of my thoughts on their self-abuse, but those ones aren't really the type to pay any mind to the opinions of others. The rest are pretty well aware by now, since my being vegan long ago got them started on thinking I was shaming them by not eating their cooking.

I have really come to appreciate how much they are BS'ing it half the time. I'll be shadowing and some girl comes in saying she's depressed. Doc will be like ""hmmm have you ever tried *insert medicine here* before?"" then she starts taking medicine for her depression...

And you're definitely right about my yearning for psychiatric labels. I'd blame my curiosity on that; I can't stand to not know exactly what's going on. I know I know, I'm probably out of luck on that one with the inherent difficulty of psychology. 

As to what I've been diagnosed, I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, SAD, GAD, OCD, ADD, and hallucinations triggered by deep seizures. That's off the top of my head, but that's the general overview of my mental health diagnosis. 

One thing I do know, this whole talk is reassuring and will definitely spark discussion with my next psychiatric meeting. "

cquh8lk&Cynicalbrit&2095conash&"I thank you for the response as this actually is some good stuff to think about, however I don't entirely agree with some of your opinions (setting aside what Nick was saying or meant for now). Namely because it's ignoring that we're ALREADY getting broken games on the market even without companies able to lean on modders to earn more money for shipping out a broken product (Assassin's Creed Unity comes to my mind), and this in of itself I think breaks down a fair amount of your reasoning because they don't have to ship out a broken product for the sake of relying on mods, but mods can certainly reinforce an already existing and shitty business practice.

That said, I do feel confident that all of that said the free market WILL work itself out, since gamers seem to be able to band together to say lash out at Valve for this paid mod stuff, I imagine that these broken games won't thrive in the long run and eventually companies will not ship out shoddy products regardless of the modding scene.

However, TB has himself voiced concerns when games offer to sell say experience boosts and how it worries him that they might have made it take longer to level up naturally to better sell it, and I think this fear of abusing paid mods to be of the same vein, but I also imagine that some people would get upset and fix any bugs and release those mods for free, even if there are 11 paid versions, someone will make a free version for the same reason we have free mods existing in the first place, to better the game.

All that said, my third paragraph in the previous post was about my issues with how Nick dealt with this subject (regardless as to how paranoid or optimistic either side might be), he seemed to only spend a few seconds on the aspect of these notions being absurd for what they were at the beginning and end, while he spent awhile talking about how Bethesda wouldn't do that, how Bethesda releases such quality DLC, how mods just don't stack up to what Bethesda does, so Bethesda would never use paid mods to replace DLC, and TB and Robin needed to come in and point out that everything Bethesda touches isn't perfect and made of gold, but that doesn't change the fact that Bethesda in of itself is irrelevant to the issue because again, even IF things go perfectly for Bethesda games, IF the system is broken then it's broken and OTHER companies at least will use it, which he didn't really spend any time on. He dismissed the concerns as being from conspiracy theorists, talked about how Bethesda would never do it, and once again dismissed the concerns as being from conspiracy theorists, I don't think he ever supported his arguments, he left it up to the listener to make up his reasoning for him and while I think I understood what he meant the fact that he spent more time talking about how Bethesda wouldn't do these things rather then the how say Valve/EA/Ubisoft wouldn't do them left me feeling like he didn't even understand the issue in the first place. All that time he spent talking about Bethesda was what was supposed to be supporting his argument that these concerns are paranoid fantasies, and if he can't seemingly 'support' his conclusions without going off-topic then I don't think that he really knew what the issue was in the first place (assuming that he wasn't maliciously putting up a smokescreen to straw-man the concerns, which I really don't think he was trying).

All that said, even though I am critical of him, and perhaps even too harshly in this post, I did enjoy what he had to say in a number of places and did enjoy his perspective at times, and I have a lot of respect for someone whom can be so dedicated as to be in the modding scene for 10 years putting out such good content, but just like anyone else his opinions and ideas must stand on their own merit and not just that of his character.

Sorry for rambling and for if my previous post misrepresented how I feel that how Nick supported his argument was inherently irrelevant to the discussion. I thank you none the less for your thoughts!"

cquh8ml&Military&DOCisaPOG&"It's one week of train up, one week of rigorous testing. Generally by the time you do the ruck you're pretty beat up from the week of studying and testing, so that adds a little bit of difficulty to the ruck. It's 12 miles in 3 hours which isn't difficult for anyone who is regularly rucking, but many of the officers in the medical field are doctors or nurses, so they likely haven't rucked much before. In fact, they're arguably closer to civillian than military. 

Again, the chances of this officer ever having to do a 12 mile ruck in real life are virtually zero, but she was able to do it (even if it was ugly in the home stretch) so she earned the EFMB. Congrats to her. "

I was heading to my dealers place with a friend of mine, and as we were going up I was telling my friend that he had to keep his cool with this guy.  We get to his place and as hes weighing my trees I ask him about his dab setup, and he offers me and my friend a dab.  Of course we both had to say yes so he told us what we had to do and got the dabs ready.  I went first, took a solid hit and got high as shit [8-9] but was able to keep it together.  My friend who smokes way less goes second.  The hit he took is still today one of the biggest, milkiest dab hits ive ever seen in my life.  He started coughing instantly, like it was almost like he was still inhaling and coughing, and kept coughing for like 5 minutes.  Then he rolled over, looked at us real funny, and greened out on my dealers couch for like a half hour.  I was still sitting there with my dealer who didnt appreiciate when kids crashed on his couch, high as fuck, trying to make small talk.

cquh8pg&starcitizen&SlothlyRage&"I disagree. We already know that ships needed for SQ42 are being developed first, and given that many of these are secret we won't hear about them. After that comes pledge ships prioritized by the number of pledges, size/complexity, or to test new mechanics in development.

We are regularly told when ships enter and approach completion of  different stages of release (Concept, Hanger, Flight). I agree that a short section of ATV which gives this update is a good idea, so you don't have to search through RTV notes.

I don't think reports on every ship being worked on at any time is a good idea, priorities change, teams working on ships can be prioritized for weeks to work on another ship which gets flagged as being required sooner, or for core gameplay systems/releases. It would just cause crying is the forums about why X ship I pledged for is 'delayed'."

cquh8r7&australia&muddlet&"sorry if this sounds SJW-y but please bear with me. something that has proven to exacerbate the problem is statements like this from a person in a position of power that says ""women are *inviting* rape if they walk home alone when it's dark."" this is because those people who are rapists see a statement like that as validation that they're not doing anything wrong, the woman is ""asking for it"". 

women *should* be able to walk home at night and be safe. the reality is that this isn't the case. but telling the world that she deserves whatever comes to her is pretty fucked up. 

there are three things here, i think:

1) we should be telling people that it is never ever acceptable to rape someone, not that women are inviting it in certain situations

2) women should have access to pepper spray or other non-lethal protective equipment. i remember in high school our teacher told the girls to walk home with their keys between their fingers wolverine style. this is all women have to protect themselves at the moment. it is very impractical for many women to be home by dark. (if women don't give up their jobs to be home by dark then they're inviting rape? nope)

3) we should be actively working towards a society where it *is* safe for all genders to be out alone at night not just saying ""well it's dangerous so deal with it"""

Working with a team, I need to be more flexible and try to figure out what works best for everyone.

4. Do you ever fly with patients home or is it just driving? 

5. Is it done solo or do you have a partner to assist you with the patient or client? 

6. Would you possibly explain some of the duties you attend to with your patients?

7. How did you find out about it in the first place?

cquh8ud&magicTCG&SnesC&"Wizards tried doing the nostalgia trip twice already, first with Time Spiral, then with Coldsnap.  Neither one sold very well, so I think they'd be very hesitant to try tapping that well again.  Also, like I said before, Dominaria is a huge place.  If you want to tell any kind of focused story, you'll need to pick just one location and deal with what's going on there, and that's going to leave some old fans dissatisfied because why didn't they go to *my* favorite sub-continent?

Wait, I think I've got it: Dominaria is to Theros, Ravnica, Zendikar, Innistrad, and Mirrodin, as Urza is to Elspeth, Jace, Nissa, Sorin, and Koth.  The former are gigantic, with extensive histories that, as a new player, feel almost impenetrable.

Really, your best-case scenario would be to get someone like Gatomon as a partner, who would probably pass for a regular cat (albeit with unnatural markings, though you could just say it's hair dye).

cquh8vk&serialpodcast&catesque&"I said ""offhand"" because this says nothing about whether Adnan loaned Jay his phone.   Did Adnan just leave his phone in the car and Jay found it by accident and started to use it?  Or did Adnan leave his phone in the car and tell Jay ""hey, I'm leaving my cellphone right here, you should check it out"".

We know the first isn't true since Adnan was planning to call Jay to pick him up (whether after track or after school doesn't matter).  So we know that Adnan left his phone with Jay with the intention of Jay using the phone, at least to receive calls.  And calling Jay only works if Jay keeps the phone on him, so Adnan obviously intended for Jay to take the phone out of the car.   Most of us would classify that as a loan.  The fact that Adnan didn't physically hand the phone to Jay isn't relevant.

Also, we know Adnan told Jay to use the phone to receive calls, so it makes sense that they talked about making calls, right?  I've never seen the slightest hint from either of them that Jay using the phone to make calls was in some way surprising. 

So how isn't this a loan?

cquh8w9&masseffect&mafol&"I really like Kaidan, partly because he's adorable (""Mom was right: I should have brought a sweater""), but partly because he just seems human and relatable compared to most of the other characters, he's virtually the sole voice of reason in ME2 (I hated Shepard working with Cerberus), and I like his backstory and the way his relationship with Shepard develops over the course of the series.  I don't really get why people think he is bland.

Apparently this isn't a common opinion, but I don't like Javik.  It was interesting to see Liara's romantic vision of the protheans being challenged, but I don't think it was necessary to conjure up a real life prothean to achieve that.  His survival seems implausible, he adjusts to the contemporary culture too easily, and it doesn't make sense how few people react when you take him to the Citadel or on missions.  Maybe it would have worked better if he was central to the story rather than a DLC companion.  Also, you'd think someone would consider the possibility that there might be other surviving protheans somewhere and that there might still be hope for his species, but I don't remember anyone mentioning that - he just says that he plans to go back to Eden Prime and die in the event that the reapers are defeated.  Both the protheans and the reapers should have been left more mysterious, really."

Obviously none of this has been accomplished before because the Mensis ritual and Merog's Wet nurse are still around by the time we show up.

Sure not ALL of them are that bad, but the majority of some of the worst drivers are the elderly. I can understand them getting old and such so they might start forgetting what seems like obvious rules to us, but that's why I wish they would have to test once in a while. As a person who lived his entire life with elderly as his guardians, they are actually scary to be in the car with. My first guardian, my grandmother on my moms side, had the sense to never use the freeway at least at her age. My second guardian (Got care over me when I turned ~13), drove terribly. She would do crazy stunts. You said that on this day you saw a car move over 3 lanes, my grandma once skipped over 4 to make a left turn, with essentially no consideration to the cars in those lanes. When we were lost she would drive close to 10MPH no matter what zone. I'm glad someone else has noticed this and actually said something haha. I hope you don't run into any more of these crazy situations.

Sales taxes are good taxes - and the negative impacts can be offset by giving lower-income people (such as the seniors everyone seems worried about) grants to off-set their tax burden.

Since the province brought in nearly $1 billion from its portion of the HST last year, the increase from 8% to 10% should net it another $225-$230 million or so (after roughly accounting for a possible decrease in spending). Not a bad chunk of change."

cquh94k&GlobalOffensive&jewnior109&"Most of my engagements in pistols rounds go something like, person jumps around a corner then starts spamming A D A D A D and crouches occasionally, making it impossible for me to hit. Generally happens when they have a glock, but it is no more difficult with a USP or P2000. Running accuracy is a joke. I understand to a certain extent the glocks being more accurate while moving than the CT pistols, but in their current state, pistols (default and others) are incredibly luck based and unbalanced.

TLDR: Make standing still and tapping with pistols more rewarding. Decrease movement accuracy of all pistols. Only pistol that can 1-hit head armor should be deagle."

If you're shooting at a wanted criminal and a civilian jumps in the way and gets hit, that's accidental.

If you're aiming at a civilian and forget that your holding a gun in stead of a camera, that's *not* accidental.

It's also worth noting that you can't assume someone is wanted under any circumstances. Even if the system authority are shooting at them, you cannot assume they are wanted. They may simply have a hostile reputation with the local faction so that they get attacked even though they aren't wanted.

Wait until you can confirm their wanted status before firing.

Most employers are not going to look through your github with a monocle. They might take a glance, but very few will deny you a chance based on that alone.

The functional rule when making a list like that would be to use any plurals at the end of the sentence.

""Among those interviewed were Kris Kristofferson, Robert Duvall and Merle Haggard's two ex-wives.""

""This book is dedicated to God, Ayn Rand and my parents.""

Personally i think the 'lazy' way to write is to use the Oxford comma primarily, because you don't have to worry about what order your list is in and can just write as the ideas come along. Not using it and still having functional grammar requires more thought or editing.

That said, I use the Oxford more often than not. In data sets, you really should always separate out individual items via comma."

Sure, we can all get up and vote out all the folks that represent us and hopefully the new lot will replace the UNELECTED officials that are in charge of monitoring the media.

If there is a law that says you can't own a gun, then you aren't free to arm yourself.  Same goes for voting and every other example you gave.  If there's a law limiting your ability to do something, then ya ain't free to do it.  (don't confuse that for me supporting or not supporting these laws)

We could all also hold hands, play guitar, and never have a war again.  Or get off our collective asses, get some exercise, and not be an on average overweight nation.  Or one of a million scenarios that let's face it isn't gonna happen.  We can enact small amounts of change, or help get process adjusted, but once the cat's out of the bag with regulation it's not going back in. So you'll never be able to do whatever you want in the media, which would be what a free media is.  Not everyone can buy any gun by law, which means there isn't a  universal right to arm yourself.

So no, those are not all universal freedoms, they may be free to you but a tobacco executive, an ex convict, or a homeless person trying to vote would have very different opinions."

cquh97y&vegan&xeLk-&"Honestly, vegan food has no calories. I'm cutting and I sometimes struggle to reach my 2000 calories a day.

Smoothies are my only source of dark leafy greens, though. I can't stand eating them so drinking them is the only option.

You don't have to enjoy smoothies to gulp them down. Most of the time I just do spinach + berries + some flax seeds, but thats all low calorie stuff.

Oats, peanut butter/nuts, bananas and lots of plant milk might work and can easily get you 800+ calories. Maybe even add some protein powder."

Leona is incredibly passive until she can get a lead off a misposition, gank, roam while Thresh is basically Janna with pick potential + stronger punish in lane. Thresh is a far better trading champ and has a lot more room to play aggro in lane though, and in general is the end all of the support role rn.

If you like aggro supports you probably want to pick up something like Sona Lulu Nami who basically aim to fight the entire lane phase and win off superior trading + without hard committing to a fight."

I've also read more about this, since then.

Essentially the big corporations RUSHED (hurry!) to release new plastic products, simply so that they could boast, in huge marketing letters, that they are:

**** BPA FREE! Buy me now! *****

Supposedly many development chemists warned them that the new plastics could be just as bad (and in fact some say they are actually WORSE for your health). 

But of course the CEO's and marketing execs, purposely IGNORED that, and didn't even bother to initiate further tests, because they really don't give a flying f--k about your health, nor the health of your kids. 

The general public, being sometimes pretty stupid (especially myself included), really rejoiced when we saw, ""BPA FREE!"", and over-trustingly bought those products, falling victim to their marketing, hook, line, and sinker... 

We never, even bothered to really ask ourselves, and the companies, a few basic questions about the supposed new material plastic.

**[Florida has a very broad Public Records Law. Virtually all written communications to or from School District Personnel are public records available to the public and media upon request. E-mail sent or received on the School District system will be considered public and will only be withheld from disclosure if deemed confidential pursuant to State Law.]**

cquh9ap&AskReddit&TheEmaculateSpork&"CNN is shitty too, but the mistakes they make are less obvious than Fox news. Like one I remember in particular, they were reporting a story leading up to the Beijing Olympics and it was about Chinese police beating protesters, yet the picture clearly showed that the officer was:

1) Not Chinese as he was very dark skinned.

2) Not wearing a Chinese police uniform (it had some other language on the badge)

Turns out the police was Nepalese, but most Americans won't catch that if they just look at the news. Whereas Bill O'Reilly exclaiming that we don't know how the tide works is clearly bullshit to anyone with half a brain.

So yes, CNN also misinforms, but it's usually less obvious than Fox. And I don't really think it has a liberal bias, if you want to see liberal bias look at MSNBC, and even they're not as bad as Fox. Mostly American TV news is shit, the only news source I really trust in the U.S in NPR."

cquh9er&AskHistorians&Worthless_J&"The statement that the war was fought over state rights is an old way of thinking about the war.  It wasn't.  If it was fought over state's rights then why did the South push so hard to violate Northern state's rights with the fugitive slave act?  The state's rights argument is an old, sympathetic, southern apologist style label that is given for southerners fighting the war.  They might have even believed that themselves, but really they were trying to protect their ""Peculiar institution.""

cquh9gr&swrpg&BilliousBT&"You can't heal wounds if you fail the check, but you can still heal strain with advantage and critical hits with triumph.

For example:

Jax, wound threshold 12, is unconscious having taken 13 wounds.  He also received a critical hit (broken arm) and has five strain damage from using abilities in the combat before he went down.

The groups droid medic, 1G-0R, tries to fix him up, fails the check but rolls 2 advantage and a triumph.

1G-0R, splints Jax's arm and shoots him up with a stimulant.  Jax briefly wakes up but passes out again from the pain.  He removes 2 points of strain and the critical hit.

1G-0R curses in binary and injects him with a stim healing several wounds and Jax wakes up having reduced his wounds below his wound threshold.

Narratively his arm is sill broken, but usable and he suffers no ill effects.

Note:  Personally I don't like the auto-heal critical hit effect for ongoing effects like that.  Any non-incidental crits should take time to heal."

A lot of his campaign was based off of the fact that he wasn't a politician.  In one of the opening statements I believe he made the remark ""Well they have a point, I don't have any experience in running up a four trillion dollar debt.""

cquh9j9&americanbulldog&IDRATHERBEAMERMAID&"Agree. Had an issue with our AB attacking our Cocker out of nowhere after like a year. Re-established dominance, our cocker gets everything first (fed, treats, let out of the kennel, etc) and our AB really just requires us to boss/push/shove her around more. Also we were told to always punish her if she tries to bully him. Show her that she doesn't get to boss anyone around. You can catch signs of it, she will bump him, or if he's laying down she will make him move, or take his toys, if we are petting him she will push her way through. So we scold her if she tries bullying him, take the toys away from her that she steals from him, if she moves him we make her get up and put him back. Push her away if we are petting him.  Basically just put her in her place. 

Also, that is the correct way to break up a fight. I'll add spinning. Pull the back legs and spin either clockwise or counter-clockwise so they lose balance. Problem with bully breeds is they latch on and don't let go so one time I pulled and the other dog came dangling with. I was also told you can jab them in the ribs to try and get them to open their jaw. Or they also make sticks or things you can put in their jaw to pry it open. It's difficult though in the midst of a fight! One thing I will say is keep your cool. Dogs feed off your energy so if you're freaking the f out that'll just rile them up even more. "

"" Resources to absorb are below. They will answer some of the questions you asked, and some of the questions you will ask yourself eventually

* My newbie FAQ intro video. You might be beyond some of it though. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRYkUIhujlc
* Find RCModelReviews on youtube, and watch all four parts of his recent ""Build a Mini Quad"" series. This is a 250 sized ""racer"" setup.
* Find FliteTest on youtube and watch the electrohub build video. This is a 450 sized setup similar to the phantom.
* Find FliteTest's beginner plane series. It isn't multicopter specific, but still has a lot of good info.

Your first point of decision is what do you want the quad to do? If you are more interested in photography, a larger 450+ sized quad is what you want to be researching. If you want fast racing FPV, you probably want to research a 250 sized quad."""

cquh9jn&Christianity&cupiam_veritate&"Well, just as an examination of the text, the initial term ""the heavens and the earth"" is extremely broad and can be taken to mean ""all physical matter and things described below"". It appears to be a Catch all for all of creation. Then the later verses go into more detail about our little corner of the  and the things relevant to us. So, even though it doesn't explicitly say ""God created water"", it is a de facto reality covered by Genesis 1:1.   
  
But we should avoid overanalyzing a 6000 year text that tells a legendary creation story. It is a theological text, not a historical or scientific one. Thus the theological message is that very first verse: ""In the Beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.""

So while I'd agree it's a dosage issue, an adulterant is most likely not the case.  Even if it's not alprazolam it's almost certainly another benzodiazepine.

Any GABA agonist in high doses has the potential to give rebound anxiety, and when you wake up in the morning with a feeling of panic you can't understand - it may just make you do irrational things like punch a hole in your door.

I don't know this reaction though, so these ligands may have some effect on the stereochemistry of the reaction or on the mechanism directly. So it's probably very case dependent on whether or not a prof will tell you what  the reagent is. Although in OP's case, it looks like the student immediately gave up as soon as they saw it.

cquh9mh&AskReddit&Madock345&"In the actual Lovecraftian mythos, Cthulhu is pretty far down the totem pole. He's an ex-slave who learned a little of his master's magic, got a big head, and tried to lead a revolution against the Elder Gods. This got him and the other Great Old Ones banished to other dimensions or sealed away in the earth. He's still way more powerful than a normal human, but more because of his psychic abilities and magical knowledge than his physical power. He was still asleep when the boat hit him, so most of his powers and defenses were offline.

He got popular online because he actually has a describable physical form, where most of the Lovecraft creatures don't, he also had three stories about him, where the others got one each. A lot of the more crazy shit people say about him would be more accurately attributed to the Elder Gods."

While I do appreciate them as beautiful works of art that does not make them beautiful people. The key here is to remember their origins as meaning to appeal to the aristocracy and in those days the physical distinctions between the rich and the poor were highly apparent. These painting aren't meant to indicate what the artists or people of those times would find attractive, more what the aristocracy of those times looked like.

cquh9sf&wicked_edge&ubernerd83&"YouTube is your friend.  I have found [mantic59's](https://www.youtube.com/user/mantic59/videos) videos to be particularly useful.

And ditto to a previous commenter on some sort of aftershave splash or balm.  You can get Nivea for Sensitive Skin aftershave balm at pretty much any big box/grocery/drug store, and I've heard good things about it.  I'm still new, but this is what I do:

Before anything else: Map the direction of your beard growth.  It's different for everyone, and can even be different on different parts of your face.

Prep: Shower.  Wash face.  Soak brush while showering.

Lather: Shake out your brush a little bit.  Dip the tips of your brush in your shave cream.  Use circular motions to lather your cream in a bowl, adding water as needed.  Or do it directly on your face.  Or in your palm.  Apply to face.

Shave: Use no pressure.  The idea is beard reduction, not elimination.  Do one pass with the grain of your beard.  Re-lather, and do a second pass across the grain.  If you're doing okay, do a third pass across the grain the other direction.  You might eventually want to do an against the grain pass, but I'd wait until you get the hang of it.

After: Rinse your face with cold water.  Apply some witch hazel.  Apply aftershave balm.

Definitely watch some videos from various people before you start, though.  Also, go to [TryABlade](http://www.tryablade.com) and get some sampler packs.  You'll find that some blades work better for you than others, and you'll need to do some experimentation to find ""your blade,"" because everyone's face is different.

Good luck, and don't be discouraged!  It takes time to find the procedure and products that work the best for you."

If it's as easy as selecting it directly, you will get a large influx of short attention span players who will ruin it for the rest of us.  I agree with you that options are good, but this option would lead to a large number of complaints that the raids are too hard.  This already happened when VoG came out.  I sure as hell don't want Bungie catering to the casual gamer at the expense of hard end-game content.  

I haven't even had to resort to LFG or any other third party websites.  I made all my friends in-game.  Play a bunch of ROC strikes with someone?  Friend Invite.  Need a PvP buddy?  Crucible Friend Invites.  Someone waves to me at the tower?  Friend Invite.  It's really not that hard.  I'm shocked at the lack of effort leading to all these complaints."

Our hotel union here is very active and organized, and not just around labor issues but around issues like the environment, immigration, affordable housing, etc. 

But other issues like increased AA representation? Yeah, it's just not that much of an issue here. I was part of the Asian American Journalists Association on the mainland and thought I'd get involved with the Hawaii chapter when I moved here. I thought the chapter here would be huge because there are so many AA reporters here. Turns out it's a small and relatively inactive chapter. AAJA's key issues are newsroom diversity and fair representation of AAPI's in the media. My guess is that here in Hawaii, where AAs are well represented in the newsroom and fairly represented in the media, AAJA's key issues don't resonate as much. "

cquh9tp&DebateReligion&EndiaBanana&"I think there are variables about alien life that we don't have any comprehension of yet, but here's what I will say: if they evolved and have a genetic code that follows many of the same patterns as life on earth, as I suspect they might, it's possible that they could develop religion in the same way I believed humans developed religion. When humans settled down and began to farm, we created polytheitic religions like the gods of farming and fertility because they were an entity responsible for outcomes in our lives, which we could try to work with to gain more control over our own lives. For example, I'm a farmer and I want my crops not to fail this year, because last year there was a horrible flood and I'm trying to recover. I pray to the gods of rain and crops and sacrifice a goat to them or something. Makes sense. 

As human civilization became more advanced we began to philosophize, innovate, and create political systems. Religions evolved along with civilizations and humanity as a whole. We developed religions that give us answers to big existential questions *as well* as being useful to cure cancer or solve the problem of existence, or to give us an objective moral code. 

So I can imagine aliens would have religion and/or philosophy in different forms. But their religion may look quite different from ours. If you look at the various religions among mankind through history, you'll notice that in some areas of the world religion is extremely different. For example, in Japan, many people are not religious, or only vaguely religious, and they all tend to believe in science. In America there is still a real struggle between fundamentalism and reason.

If that kind of religious variation can exist on this planet alone, I can imagine some aliens might do things we never thought to do with religion. If they came to Earth, their religions and ours might mix for some people. For others, there would be tension. Some aliens might be atheists. And aliens that were once religious might stop being religious when they find us, and some humans might give up religion as well. At the same time, aliens and humans may adopt religions for nearly the same reason. 

To sum it up, I think aliens will have weird religions and complicated relationships just like ours on earth in some ways, and totally different in others. Our meeting would cause everyone to pause on the nature of reality and would lead to an interesting new dynamic all around. "

cquh9uh&aviation&MattyHurricane&Your second sentence is the end of it.  He violated his clearance.  Whether the tower wants to make a big deal out of it is a totally separate issue, and has nothing to do with OP's question.  In aviation, the words really mean something.  Not just to the tower and the pilot who are talking, but to all of the other aircraft that are listening as well, and anticipating what's developing.  It's not up to the OP to decide what is a big deal or not a big deal, and he needs to learn and remember that now.  What happens one of these days when he's flying into an uncontrolled airport and announces that he's on final for a runway, and then just decides to do a touch an go or needs to go around, and doesn't announce that he's doing something other than landing?  Other airplanes in the pattern or on the ground are positioning themselves based on what someone has announced they are doing.  In this case, he had the option, he announced is intent to land, was cleared to land, and decided to keep flying.  That's a problem.  If he needed clarification, he should have asked ATC if he was still cleared to continue the approach.  ATC would have then confirmed that he was still cleared for the option.

Just because TF got a nerf over something *kind of* similar doesn't mean Annie should have the exact same thing done to her. 


You might as well be asking why Garen ult doesn't do true damage, because Darius's does and they both spin. 


For starters, TF card has a pretty low cooldown and most importantly can be activated on the spot. It doesn't require a certain amount of other casts to happen, isn't charged.


If you actually think her stun should deteriorate after a few seconds then you must have never played Annie. This would ruin the champion.

I understand and agree with your points, I am simply asking you to think as if you are in your sisters shoes. I also feel you have made up your mind as to your sisters fate if you tell, when your fears could be completely unfounded, you are not a professional, and are not qualified to make a decision in the case of abuse. Your social worker and others involved deal with these situations countless times and will have experience that none of us here would have. Just bear that in mind mate. If you are happy with the way you go I think that's fine. I just want to try and help you see that just because there's abuse doesn't mean your sister would be instantly removed from your parents.

It's true that Xanax has a high chance for abuse. Withdrawal is also fucking terrible, and I assume your doctor is trying to protect you. he has probably prescribed you the SSRI in an attempt to reduce anxiety in the long run. Try coupling this with therapy as well so you're not so dependent on Xanax.

cquh9yt&TwoXChromosomes&MoreDblRainbows&"I just randomly clicked here as it its on the second page. I thought from the title it would be  the OP being incendiary and mincing words to make a narrative. 

However, the mayor literally said a woman walking alone is an invitation to be attacked. That is craziness. The implication is that no woman should ever walk anywhere alone for fear of being attacked by men. That is ridiculous (for men and women). I can't believe that people are trying to launch a defense for that (rather I can believe it, they just shouldn't)

But outside of this. I think that it should be acceptable to tell women how and why to protect themselves in certain situations. Like we tell people don't go to ""bad"" parts of town or you might get hurt. It should be ok to tell women, ""Hey don't drink too much or this, and this may happen (including possible sexual assault). 

My issue is that this is almost always done after the fact. Which is horrible. That is blaming. In my mind, there's a huge difference between a warning of a possible action and blaming someone for someone else's actions. 

 I'm not sure that made sense but thought I'd get it all out. 

Edit: After thinking about it I feel this way for all crimes not just sexual assault. Like I'm ok with telling young men don't stay out at bars too late because it gets crazy at closing time. But I would never say to someone who was just beaten to a pulp through no fault of their own that they invited that person to do it by virtue of being there. I realize this is a pretty odd needle to thread, but I'm hoping someone else will read this and be able to flesh out the thought. "

cquh9z1&AskReddit&hippiebanana&"As a European, I do tip in the US, and I think everyone is responsible for researching local customs before travelling anywhere - but I would also come at this topic feeling like the European way is superior because frankly it is. You earn a liveable wage, and often get tips on top if you do your job well (even if you don't sometimes - I think many Americans think tipping is totally unheard of here which is blatantly untrue, it's just most often directly related to service). You will always, always make a reliable, consistent income as long as you work the hours, which will always be minimum wage (which is also much higher in Europe) or above. 

Also, tipping in Europe means something because it's not compulsory. Tipping in the US is a way for businesses to cop out of paying their employees properly. I don't think that thinking the European way is better gives me a free pass from tipping in the US, or taking out my problems with the businesses on their employees. But yes, sorry, but I do think it's superior for tipping to mean something and for employees to be paid properly and fairly for the work they have done."

I shopped for newer vans and found that the style I wanted were out of my price range (I only wanted to pay cash) and were not as attractive to me. I want to love what I'm living in and the older styles appeal to me. It's carpeted, the windows are tinted and it has slide windows that help with air circulation. I wouldn't pass up the older vans. Lots of people buy these for road travel and hardly use them but hang on to them so usually only one or two owners.

cquha0f&Christianity&lapapinton&"This quote from Alvin Plantinga on the topic is a classic:

""On the most common contemporary academic use of the term, it is a term of abuse or disapprobation, rather like ‘son of a bitch’, more exactly ‘sonovabitch’, or perhaps still more exactly (at least according to those authorities who look to the Old West as normative on matters of pronunciation) ‘sumbitch’. When the term is used in this way, no definition of it is ordinarily given. (If you called someone a sumbitch, would you feel obliged first to define the term?) Still, there is a bit more to the meaning of ‘fundamentalist’ (in this widely current use): it isn’t simply a term of abuse. In addition to its emotive force, it does have some cognitive content, and ordinarily denotes relatively conservative theological views. That makes it more like ‘stupid sumbitch’ (or maybe ‘fascist sumbitch’?) than ‘sumbitch’ simpliciter. It isn’t exactly like that term either, however, because its cognitive content can expand and contract on demand; its content seems to depend on who is using it. In the mouths of certain liberal theologians, for example, it tends to denote any who accept traditional Christianity, including Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, and Barth; in the mouths of devout secularists like Richard Dawkins or Daniel Dennett, it tends to denote anyone who believes there is such a person as God. The explanation is that the term has a certain indexical element: its cognitive content is given by the phrase ‘considerably to the right, theologically speaking, of me and my enlightened friends.’ The full meaning of the term, therefore (in this use), can be given by something like ‘stupid sumbitch whose theological opinions are considerably to the right of mine’."""

cquha0z&strife&EyedeaOne&"I think it's a temporary solution because, like I said, it gives this MM a better chance to make fair match ups. Which is something extremely important in a MOBA. It's really hard to find an other 5 stack or other players good enough in solo or duo queue to go against that stack. I agree that it's not the best solution, it sucks that S2 had to do this and I really hope they figure something better real soon. But S2 wants to keep the queue time short, and give their MM system a chance at matching people properly. So for now, sadly, I think it's for the best.

That being said, I find it a bit weird that people like me can enjoy the game in solo queue (and yes, I really like to win.. I'm pissed and stop playing if I lose more than once in a row) and other players can't enjoy it even when they can team up with 2 friends. 

But I totally understand your point of view: that people should simply have the freedom to team up with whoever they want (it's a team game after all)... that, fair match ups and short queue times are all extremely important in MOBAs."

cquha27&3DS&SicilianEggplant&"I got really into PAD as well (level 60-something), but hit that wall (can't think of what level it was, but it's a common issue at a specific place that many have) where the game went from ""struggling to win and having fun"" to ""getting my ass handed to me with no chance of survival"". 

I spent $5 or $10, tried to get the most out of my team, and ultimately ended up reading more about the game than actually playing it.  The game was fairly gradual in its difficulty up until that point, but all of the time and effort I took to just keep getting nowhere near beating any part of that area completely turned me off of the game. It felt that you went from having teams and getting by to having to min/max a perfect setup in order to progress. 

That, and the constant fear of losing my save data and potentially requiring specific knowledge of monsters and other account info (user reports of the info required to restore an account is rage inducing) just made it even more difficult for me to keep caring about the game. 

Not having to deal with most of that has made me really excited for the 3DS version."

For starts, yesterday I spent all night doing homeworks, even when I was sick with a cold, because I spent the afternoon in the mail office to send some cards. They are currently on strike, so the process was slower than ussual. So it was already late when I started my homeworks.

Today I had to wake up earlier than usual because I needed to practice for an exposition I had to do for class. So I slept very little. When classes finally ended and I got home to take a well-deserved nap for my headaching self, my brother called, asking me to take the train and deliver something to him. After another two hours, I finally got home again. Not even 10 minutes passes after I go to bed, dogs start barking, neighbors begin talking out loud...

And now, I have just been reloading your reddit post over and over in hopes of some news about that ""certain someone"". Head hurts like hell, but I wouldn't have rest assured without knowing anything.

You see, everything is working against my need of sleep. I blame RNG.

cquha69&legaladvice&CujoCrunch&"If an attorney can help you plead to a charge that doesn't combine the words ""battery"" and ""officer"", it will do you a world of good. Yes, lawyers are expensive, but you should borrow money if you have to. 

Just imagine what ""Misdemeanor Battery on a Peace Officer"" will look like on an employer's background check next time you apply for a job: *""This guy attacked a cop?!""*

cquha6h&AmIFreeToGo&DILYGAF&"It sounds like the police were using the possible exigent circumstances of evidence being destroyed to enter the house. 

In the pdf you linked, it says the officers followed a suspected drug dealer to the house, and claimed to smell marijuana. This sounds as though they are claiming that following a suspected drug dealer to a house, and claiming to smell marijuana is probable cause for a search, and then used the sounds coming from the house to manufacture exigent circumstances. It doesn't in my opinion, but that doesn't count for shit. 

I believe that if police officers pulled this shit, and didn't find any drugs, they would have opened themselves up to a civil suit.

Even with the information you provided (thanks for the reading material) it doesn't change the fact that demanding the police obtain a warrant before they are allowed inside my house is a perfectly acceptable response to them banging on the door."

cquha6x&bridge&BridgeBum&"More specifically, Go is a game of complete information.  Given a board state we could compute a solution given enough time and resources.  

Bridge is a game of incomplete information and much of the challenge is not only is solving a given ""board state"", but even deducing what the board state is.  

In addition, the partnership aspect of bridge makes it a very different dynamic.  Solo efforts are quite different from team based cooperation, especially when the rules of the game itself enforce limited communications.  (Bidding, signalling)

Where the luck factor comes in could be somewhat similar to poker:  we can compute that we are 90% to succeed in an action, we still fail 1 time in 10.  Nothing like that in Go."

cquha97&television&Miko00&"the show started out rough, the first half of the first season was flat out bad, but man did it turn itself around and become something awesome. this scene specifically is a  great example of how a single character develops over the course of almost 2 seasons. you look at who skye was and what skye was about in the start of the show and then watch this 36 second clip and see a portion of what she has become. then keep in mind she is'nt the only character to have so much development, almost every single person has gone through drastic changes that completely changes who they are. 

Also i loved the end of the episode, with Raina's vision and Coulson talking to Maris hill, this was the last episode before the release of Age of Ultron and they set up it pretty well. they do a great job at telling the stories the movies dont have time for, showing everyone what exactly is going on in between these movies when the Avengers themsevles have yet to get involved. Raina's vision at the end of the episode was pretty good too, She saw ultron and the destruction his ""metal army"" will bring to the world and it genuinely terrified her"

cquhaaw&Fitness&sadalol&"I did CF for a year, towards the end of my 200/mth year minimum subscription, I just wanted to do strength training.

I was only allowed to do strength training as apart of a class, which was 3 days a week, tuesday, thursday, and sat.

They had 0 open gym times, unless of course you were on PED and competed or a chick, then it was ok...

I joined a rock climbing gym, also expensive, but there are incredible perks in terms of eye candy and no one touches my oly platform or squat rack

rock climbing gym is 75$/mth, still 'expensive', but far better than the 200$+ you pay for a CF gym. The only benefit of attending a CF gym are the girls, or some trainers who could actually know what their talking about.

If you dont need someone to help you, find a better gym, too expensive"

cquhab6&funny&two&"I am a proponent of the serial comma\* because:

(1) It eliminates ambiguity far more often than it causes ambiguity;

(2) Standardization of use is salutary to English language comprehension (this is an argument against keeping serial comma use a matter of personal preference);

(3) Its use is more common than its omission, which further facilitates standardization;

(4) Its use is more logical and intuitive than its omission;

(5) In longer, more complex lists that benefit from the use of semicolons, omission of the last semicolon is never a legitimate option (thus, serial comma omission promotes inconsistency of language);

(6) Those who omit serial commas often do so inconsistently;\*\*

(7) Those who use serial commas generally do so consistently; and

(8) Space economy is the only legitimate benefit of serial comma omission - and it is a mediocre priority, at best.

**That said, citing examples of its use or omission creating or resolving ambiguity is a meaningless argument.** You can find examples of literally anything going right or wrong; that doesn't mean anything.

\* I also prefer descriptive terms (serial comma) over needlessly non-descriptive terms (""Oxford"" comma or ""Harvard"" comma).

\*\* Such persons often use serial commas when connecting dependent clauses (see this list), when connecting independent clauses[,] or whenever they feel like it. To use the serial comma for shorter, simpler lists and not for longer, more complex lists is inconsistent and senseless."

cquhads&nfl&Banethoth&Not bad.
cquhadt&explainlikeimfive&PopcornMouse&"Different species are able to synthesize different nutrients themselves through cellular processes. Nutrients include carbohydrates, fats, proteins (or their building blocks, amino acids), and vitamins. This means instead of the body having to ""eat"" the protein containing a particular amino acid, the cell itself can make that amnio acid. This of course requires energy and work by the cell. Conversely, ""a nutrient is said to be ""essential"" if it must be obtained from an external source, either because the organism cannot synthesize it or produces insufficient quantities"". So there are two kinds of nutrients, those that we can make through our own cellular processes, and those we must obtain through our diet.

[Proteins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein) are made up of different [amnio acids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid). A good analogy is that a protein is like a train, and the individual cars are amnio-acids. Different combinations of cars, in different orders give different trains. In the same way, different amnio-acids, in different combinations give different kinds of proteins. Digestion, be it in animals or humans, results in the breakdown proteins into their amnio acid components. The intestine absorbs the individual amnio acids and the body ships these amnio acids to the cells. Cellular processes rearrange the amnio acids in new ways to make new proteins that are used by the animal or human for various bodily functions. So think of the cell as the railyard where new trains (proteins) are made but reassembling the cars (amnio-acids) into new and different combinations. ""Proteins perform a vast array of functions within living organisms, including catalyzing metabolic reactions, replicating DNA, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another."" All life needs protein to survive, but what the body is really after is the amino acids that make up the protein. Different species need different amino acids.

There are [nine essential amino acids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_amino_acid) that humans must consume in our diet because our cells cannot make them through cellular processes. The rest we can make ourselves in our cells. This means that our diet must meet these minimum essential amnio acids requirements in order for us to survive. We cannot make the nine, we must consume the nine. The nine are found in all kinds of foods, from plants to meat which is why humans can have such a wide variety of diets (e.g. vegetarian, vegan, allergen-accomidating) and still function normally.

However, other animals have different essential nutritional requirements. For example, [cats, unlike humans, cannot synthesize the amino acid taurine so it must be added to their diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurine#In_animal_nutrition). Some species are able to synthesize Vitamin C and do not need to consume it in their diet (e.g. mice), whereas humans cannot synthesize Vitamin C and thus are required to consume it in our diet. These differences in essential nutrient intake creates different dietary requirements for different species and results in different types of foods being consumed preferentially by different species. This is why a giraffe is able to survive and thrive just on plant material, whereas we are required to consume a more varied diet. They obtain all their unique essential nutrients from their herbivore diet.

So other species have different combinations of essential nutrients in order to sustain a balanced and healthy diet. This makes perfect sense, if all species had the exact same requirements there would be a lot of competition for the same food resources. By diversifying what is essential to consume, there is less competition. Remember that it is costly for the body to produce its own nutrients through cellular processes. It is much easier to just consume an amnio acid than produce it. Thus, if a particular amino acid or nutrient is abundant and easily available in a species environment it makes more sense for natural selection to select against the cell's producing that nutrient, and for the individual to simply consume it. For example, most primates - including humans - do not synthesize vitamin C. This makes perfect sense since vitamin C is easily acquired through our collective diets by consuming fruit. Fruit is abundant resource in most primate's environments thus vitamin C would not be hard to acquire. So each species is balancing what they need to eat, and what they can produce themselves, along with what is available to them in their environment."

On the other hand, if it's obvious that they just split one game into two to make some more money, it's a pretty skeevy thing to do.

Seriously, the dilution ratios are so high that there are mathematically zero molecules of whatever the ""active ingredient"" is in a homeopathic treatment. The purported effect comes from the ""memory"" of water.

And it's not inoculating you against an illness by showing your immune system and actual pathogen - it's treating a runny nose with something else (or rather, the ""memory"" of something else) that makes your nose run."

The cold. No ocean. People assuming I was stupid (since I lived in Florida). The cold. People not turning on red. The taxes. The cold. Really weird ways of turning left. The horrible roads. The cold. Did I mention the cold?

There were some nice things of course... like the fireflies. Summer light until like 10pm or so... 

Florida is something that when it bites, it bites hard. We've got more than 1,000 miles of coast (2nd only to Alaska) and whether it's fishing, boating, playing... there's always a ocean breeze close by. We've got lower taxes, no snow (almost no), and limited time left before global warming puts our state under water.

Like the previous poster mention and I can't stress enough that good posture, flexibility and core streght help a lot. However, once on the golf course, even if common knowledge state to be relax at address, actively engage your glutes and your abdominal muscle (as if you were trying to press down on your leg with your abs).

Put his keys on the table,

Put flowers in a copper bowl there.

He put his eggs and milk on the table.

He put there the light that came in through the window,

Sounds of a bicycle, sound of a spinning wheel.

The softness of bread and weather he put there.

On the table the man put

Things that happened in his mind.

What he wanted to do in life,

He put that there.

Those he loved, those he didn't love,

The man put them on the table too.

Three times three make nine:

The man put nine on the table.

He was next to the window next to the sky;

He reached out and placed on the table endlessness.

So many days he had wanted to drink a beer!

He put on the table the pouring of that beer.

He placed there his sleep and his wakefulness;

His hunger and his fullness he placed there.

Now that's what I call a table!

But that's where people post. For example, someone posted just yesterday about subletting their apartment (313/mo/person). Another person posted a couple days ago (305/mo , no utilities). 

I'm hesitant to post their listings here without their permission. But if you'd like, I can give them your contact info."

cquhao1&Israel&meteorblade&Your link indicates that's something that  some PA member proposed. Netanyahu would never propose such a thing.

The international community would expect that Israel evacuate and remove any settlers in what would be deemed Palestinian territory.
cquhao2&anime&Azmek&My problem with the ending of Soul Eater is that friendship *did* have a place... and they just ignored it. They spent so long getting Maka, Black☆Star and Kid to work together as a team, and they spent the entire penultimate episode rescuing Soul because his and Maka's teamwork was so important... and then in the last episode they just threw that all away and had Maka beat the villain by herself. It didn't help that the penultimate episode built up hype for the final battle *really* well, but then the last episode was just kinda a let-down.

Edit: I can't access the medical site articles about this but they all say the issue was a 'staffing row'. I'll see if my wife can get them later.

Seriously, how about you tell me what the fuck was so good about him that you'd rather have your kids look up to him than Neil Degrasse Tyson?

cquhau2&AskReddit&chickennachos&"Getting into 6th form, a lot of the teachers you've known for a while start to let you in on the occasional secret. My German teacher, when it was just me in the room (only two other people took the class) would talk to me about how embarrassed she was by this guy M who was in the class, because he ""didn't even have the knowledge to pass a GCSE in German so he sure as hell shouldn't be in here. He's just not clever enough"". There were a couple as well where she'd mention that they were ""just a complete arsehole"" and she'd cry on the drive to school thinking about how she had to deal with them. The people she described as such were actual arseholes though, like they'd sit in the common room throwing food at people trying to revise, throw over tables and stuff. Generally horrible, narcissistic people.

Led by the climate scientist Chris Turney of the University of New South Wales, the ship has been sailing through the Southern Ocean, repeating and extending many of Mawson's wildlife and weather observations in order to build a picture of how this part of the world has changed in the past 100 years.""

I don't know where you get ""These were climate scientists going out to document how all the sea ice was disappearing."" But its just ridiculous.

You also might want to consider working on a grid to avoid movement of the structure off center on each frame which is also pretty distracting.

We were supposed to go out to dinner then meet friends, but he said he forgot his wallet at his place and would I like to come up to see his apartment- to which I agreed.  We get up to his apartment and he starts asking if I'm into Astral Projection, and saying its the most liberating thing. Asking ""Do you want to try it? you could try it now, I could lead you..."" I kept saying ""It really isn't my thing, I'm not really into that spiritual stuff.""  He had given me a drink and kept saying drink up then we'll go, but feeling a little freaked out, I said I needed to eat before I drank anything. Later found out he was hard into hallucinogens.  Dunno if he just made me a drink or was so fuct that he thought he'd liberate me with an outer body experience whether I wanted one or not. He never once tried anything sexual either, so I think he really just wanted someone to trip with him.     "

cquhb0w&AskReddit&GetOutOfBox&"How can they put fourth an effort when nothing can be done? There is literally nothing that can be done by police officers. How are you supposed to put out an APB for a stolen bike? Most bikes look pretty much the same, and require very specific descriptions to differentiate. Then, even if an officer found the bike with someone, how are you supposed to prove it's yours?

It's not like this problem only happens to bikes, pretty much any kind of property theft works out this way. Police certainly don't organize huge busts trying to find things like a PS3 or diamond ring. Pretty much the only property police are able to retrieve with some success is cars, because they are something you can't hide as easily and they have unique identifiers easily visible (the license plate, and if it's removed there are lots more discrete serials hidden throughout the components)."

Extremely cheap and he even made a girl pay back $400 in paper costs for having to reprint the company newsletters...which is illegal...but he hired people in their early 20s and younger people usually are not as aware of illegal practices employers can participate in or are too scared to speak up. The turnover was SO high that in my 4 months there, 50% of the people had quit! He didn't care and would rather have high turnover for cheap labor rather than committed employees who could better the company. 35 employees
worked for him, and only THREE had been there over a year!

When I got a new job offer for 45k he tried to make me feel like it was a mistake and told me he had ""big plans for me"". Whatever, you paid me $15 an hour with no paid vacation or holidays...which is his RIGHT but don't be suprised when people jump ship.

That does not give you the typical experience of America. I've been the majority race in maybe 50% of life experience depending on how you view it.

I'm convinced the first Abercrombie was originally european night club that raved so hard Europeans exploded and their form-fitted clothing few off their bodies and folded neatly into piles. Once the police arrived on-scene they entered a darkly-lit building full of folded clothing too tight for the average person, and with far too many industrialized rips. Only the siren of euro-club techno throbbing in their ears and choking fumes of over-sprayed cologne left the deafening and pungent signs of the stereotypical Europeans which had once occupied this space."

cquhb3c&learnprogramming&missblit&"For one you basically need to:

1. Read in the number *as a string*
2. Loop over the string, accumulating the number according to the rules of positional notation.

To use 9876 as an example.

* You can convert the character '9' to the digit 9 by subtracting the character '0' from the character '9'.
* You want to end up with a number like 9\*1000 + 8\*100 + 7\*10 + 6\*1

This can be done by starting with the number 9 and shifting digits to the left via multiplication by 10:

          9
    (x10) 90
    (+8)  98
    (x10) 980
    (+7)  987
    (x10) 9870
    (+6)  9876

You might want to implement in another language first to make sure you get the logic right. This process is similar to the C `atoi` function."

cquhb3h&serialpodcast&AllNightAvenue&"I think this, as well.  No person who voluntarily comes forth with information about a murder would try to frame someone by spinning a roulette wheel that ultimately could point back at them, unless they had some knowledge of where the framee was on that day.  One thing Jay and Adnan are both maintain is that Adnan went to track that day.  Jay never tries to say he didn't attend, because he knows for a fact that witnesses could corroborate that he was there because he either dropped him off or picked him up.  

If Asia's alibi is correct, then Jay would not have dropped Adnan off, because Adnan would have gone to the library after school until track and have been seen until at least 2:40, and stranded.

So when Jay picks him up, how does Jay know that Adnan was actually at track and not just lying to Jay by saying that's where he was?  Where does that put Jay's assertions that Adnan went to track?  For all Jay knows, he could have said he was at track and been elsewhere.  This is why I think Jay did drop him off, because he would say, ""I think he was at track, at least that's where he told me he had been when I picked him up.""  Instead he says he dropped him off and picked him up.  "

cquhb80&ShouldIbuythisgame&NecroGi&"In my opinion probably not.

This is one of those fighting games that people play religiously. You'll want to play the story mode to see which character you like, however the downpour is is that the story mode gets old QUICK. 

People will quickly point out ""You don't buy fighting games for the story mode option"", however if you're new to the game and/or want to find out what characters you like the most appropriate option is to play the story mode. Which is complete shit let's be honest. "
cquhb81&AskReddit&OfTheDarkestTimeline&My dick is blue and I'm fucking terrified. 
cquhb83&witcher&BlaineWriter&"Ya, I think you might be right.. I found this comment on some site:

""Forget ANY form of decent modding with Witcher 3. The devs have confirmed the engine fully BAKES every asset of the level in one giant pre-defined streaming asset, just like iD's Rage engine used in the un-moddable Rage game (and iD/Bethesda also released - uselessly- all the tools).

All the PR for Witcher 3 is BS. Anyone who doesn't believe this hasn't been following the in-depth interviews with CDPR staff. Skyrim is the world's most moddable game because the engine is state-of-the-art in how it handles every asset and script- allowing everything to be modified/replaced on-the-fly in every level. In comparison, the dreadful engines from iD, CDPR and Crytek bake a level as a GIANT CAD OBJECT- and 'playing' the level is effectively flying a CAD viewer across the giant unitary object. The ONLY easily changeable assets are the 3D 'SPRITES'- people, monsters, particles and the like.

Watching the release build videos from Witcher 3 show that even the scripting is baked into the level- which makes for 'slicker' transitions to cut-scenes, but again makes any worthwhile modding a nightmare. Ask yourself this. How many people play modded Witcher 2? Now how many people play UN-MODDED Skyrim? While many fools mock the Skyrim engine, the Skyrim engine is built from the ground up for late stage, run-time modding and this is possibly unique in the world of game engines.

If CDPR has confidence in the choices they have made with Witcher 3, then why are they still trying to sell us so many lines of BS at this late stage? I will admit I still have my fingers crossed that the promotional team are just a bunch of complete idiots, and that the unrevealed turns out to be a terribly marketed masterpiece. But nothing I have seen or heard yet gives me much hope, and the gulf between the early videos and promises and today's imminent release materials is pretty inexplicable.""

cquhb9m&INTP&tbow2000&"Aliens.

I like to theorize who they are, what they are, what their technologies are like, how they perceive us, what kind of cognitive capabilities they have above us, etc...

This comes from having a few strange experiences that I can't explain, so believe what you want to, I chose to believe my senses and fellow witnesses.

I'll dive into a few theories of mine and extra tidbits that convinced me, specifically for those who bothered to read on.

Reflecting back on medical technology we've progressed leaps and bounds, were we've gotten to the point where we can clone a mammoth that died fromt he last ice age.  Ask humankind from the 1800's they'd think you've tapped into the powers of God himself, likewise I think the same to consciousness. At one point or another I believe they've achieved this, and in conjunction with cloning, achieved immortality. So when people think aliens have come to take the earths resources they're being extremely naive.

After watching this [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNo_dzgznNI) and [this documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN_tWSbDhw8) there was no doubt in my mind that there was some sort of advanced civilization before us. I play with the idea that aliens are really just humans that achieved interstellar travel. When you think about it aliens, like any other creature on earth, have four limbs, [two eyes, two nostrils, and a mouth.](http://www.boudillion.com/lam/greyalien.jpg) What are the chances that an legit alien that evolved from elsewhere in the universe evolve into a bipedal, let alone humanoid. 

[John E Mack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Mack) was a Harvard professor who gave up his career as a respected psychologist to study the [phenomenon of alien abduction](https://youtu.be/9uRg_2Ie4U0?t=83).  When looking at pictures of aliens drawn by separate people on separate sides of the country he noticed they were almost identical. As a psychiatrist he knew it was impossible for both people to have the exact same abduction experience if they were legitimately crazy.

Screw around in training mode for a while until you find something. Then search the character's name on /r/crazyhand and read read read. Think about and practice the strategies you see mentioned there.

But don't always play to win, either. Maybe you're just happy because you kicked a bad habit or landed a really good down smash or something. When you're sick of playing, walk away for a while."

cquhbck&relationships&IronyPenguin&"I was in a similar situation, except my mom *willingly* told me about her affair. For a full year, when I was 16, I was aware of my mom's affair. I felt it as surreal. I couldn't grasp that it was really happening. I even *met* the damn guy, and I still couldn't process it.

I didn't tell my dad. I didn't know what to do. My mom made him out to be the bad guy and the reason why she was cheating. I was 16 and didn't know better.

Honestly? I wish I had told my dad. He eventually found out and was devastated, but they tried to work on it. They ended up breaking up last year (4 years later) because he just couldn't get over it. But what devastated him most was that I knew for a year and never told him. He felt like my mom was terrible for pushing that secret on me, but deep down it was obvious he was disappointed that I didn't say anything.

You said you value your relationship with your dad. Then you should tell him. Be gentle. Be supportive. Don't act like you're full-on mad at your mom (even though she's in the wrong.) She probably feels something is missing in her relationship with your dad, but you should let them work it out as a couple, or break it off. 

Anyhow, let your dad know, be there for him, and respect his decision. He will need you."

cquhbfb&disney&iamjill&"Sounds like an awesome way to honeymoon! 

If you can swing it obviously you should try to stay at one of the Disneyland resorts. The Grand Californian is so beautiful. If not, the Hilton near the convention center is a really nice hotel, with great views of Disneyland and the fireworks (if you pay for those rooms), great customer service, and a killer breakfast buffet. Stay somewhere with a shuttle or within walking distance, as parking is expensive.  

Everyone will tell you to eat at Blue Bayou. If you do request a table by the water. They will try to tell you the wait will be much longer but it is worth it. If you are not sitting by the water then it's just a normal bustley restaurant with overpriced food (you can get the same food in New Orleans Square for cheaper). I prefer Carthay Circle over at DCA personally. I find the food to be much better and it has a luxurious feel which is nice after a long hot day walking around the parks. Both are pricey. Ariels Grotto is a different kind of feel, much more oriented towards the children. The princesses come around while you are eating to chat and take photos. It's fun, but much less romantic and just as expensive. The Storybook Cafe at the Grand Californian is kind of a fun way to do breakfast, animal characters (such as Pluto and the chipmunks) play all sorts of tricks on you while you eat and it's really kind of cute. 

I don't know much about Laguna Beach, but I am from San Diego. Feel free to PM me with any specific questions if that's where you guys decide to go. If I were you I would try and go mid September-beginning of October. The kids will have started school but the weather will still be nice and warm. Take a look at homes on Airbnb- you can get entire studios/apartments right next to the beach for much, MUCH less than a hotel room. I would aim for Carlsbad or Oceanside. Both have nice breweries, restaurants and enough to do to keep you busy for a few days. 

You might have more luck posting in /r/Disneyland, but I hope this gives you some things to chew on.

That out there there is someone who is way better for both of you and since life is so short she deserves someone who matches her better than you do. Tell her she deserves someone who can make her happier than you will something along those lines because of your feelings that have left you or something. Tell her she is someone you will remember forever and that you will always cherish the memories you had with her.

That means that you have the responsibility to use appropriate language and tone, and he is responsible for interpreting the words with the knowledge he has of you.  However, it has to start with you, because what you say and do is the only way he has to understand you.

Of course, it largely depends on exactly what is being said - a detail which is notable by its absence, by the way - and how it is said.  If the only things you ever say to him are criticisms of every little detail of what he does, then yeah - he's pretty justified in feeling attacked.

cquhbhl&riseagainst&borzughul&"You don't see the racial problems because you're WHITE. I'm white too. The racial issue happening here is that the police are continuing to think they're above the law, that they can do things like shoot unarmed black people for little reason and get away with it. That somehow they're justified in taking a man on a fucking nickel ride. For leaving criminals to die.

You can't see this because you're white. Because of privilege. The fact that you don't have to tell your children that the police inhumanely stereotype your entire race as a bunch of thugs. You don't have to be afraid of having your resume turned down because you're black, even though you're more qualified than other white people who have applied for the same job. You also don't have to worry about making less because you're black. 

Educate yourself before you go making blanket statements such as ""the only racial issue is that the black community is more dangerous than other races""

You might notice I'm angry. It's because doing shit like this distracts from the actual issue of racism and police brutality in america.

EDIT: Have a nice fucking day.

EDIT 2: Don't brand me as some fucking social justice warrior. If someone was making racist statements in public, or claiming that white people were inferior to blacks, you'd stand up. I'll stand up here. 

EDIT 3: Blacks have privilege to. So do women. EVERYONE has privilege. However those of us who are straight, white, able bodied cis males who are Christian have the most out of everyone."

cquhbio&AskReddit&prsplayer1993&"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_European_Union#Religiosity

Northern/Western Europe is between a third and 18% religious. Though it's not a majority, i'd certainly not say it's a real minority.
Similarly, the percentage professing some level of spirituality, when combined with religiosity, still outnumbers atheism for the most part, so I'd argue feeling in northern and western Europe is not laughing at the religious. 
Anecdotally, as a resident of the UK, it's quite rare to be ridiculed for my own faith.

Also, the UK, Germany, France and Belgium are hubs of the scholarly study of Christianity (a community of which I am a part). For good scholarly research to take place, an outlook of ridicule is generally discouraged, otherwise you end up with unscholarly twaddle like *The God Delusion*."

Make sure that you agree with a candidate on a variety of issues before voting for them.

Each mind has the ability to gain the same information as you but only you can choose the ultimate opinion of it all. The tree for example can be objectified as being beautiful or strong, but an existentialist thinker will see the tree for a tree; It has roots, a trunk, branches and leaves, each with the ability to be transformed into whatever he/she chooses, within the physical capabilities of said component. But truthfully, there are no answers that lie within the tree, unless you choose to ask questions that will provoke an answer. Same goes for most things in this world... unless you don't agree.

I visited New York last summer and at that time I was sort of fascinated with pregnancy. I didn't want to become pregnant myself but was just insanely curious about it, scientific fascination. When we landed, the first person I saw in the airpot was a pregnant woman. Since that day, I'd notice more and more random pregnant women every day, and each day I'd notice more than the last one. During the last day (after two weeks), I counted *8* pregnant women. 3 of them were in the same public restroom, at the same time. They acted liked strangers, obviously weren't friends or from the same birthing classes or anything. I'm from an Eastern European country and back there, I'd spot maybe one or two pregnant women a year.

cquhbsa&gaming&mrbelvebeard&"I used to drive one of them onto the downed covenant ship. Every time it would utterly destroy frame rate for everyone in the match. 

There were all sorts of dick moves that were fantastic. 

My favorite was getting a warthog full of comrades and taking them into obvious peril.  The cliffs and snow allowed for a Ethan Hunt style escape of the driver but death for the passengers.  If you allowed yourself to take a bit of enemy fire before the cliff dive.  The death would could as kills for the other team rather than a betrayal. Avalanche was great for it. As was taking the sniper rifle, pinging the shields down on the annoying little shits that always blamed the team for their low kill counts. Especially when they tried to take the shortcut through the middle of the map while there was some heavy fighting going on. 

Ranked games were always full of pretentious shits. Making them angry was a lot of fun. Take a team of 8 like minded individuals into a BTB ranked and have everyone concentrate on betrayals to where the kills were in the negative triple digits.  This angered the opposing team to no end. "

cquhbsx&changemyview&MrF33&"And I'll be less broad.

Family.

The family structure of immigrants is, generally speaking, more highly valued than your average poor American.

I'm not even saying black americans, I mean poor americans in general, have a lack of solid family structure which is most definitely a cultural thing.

The fact is that the largest advantage that middle and upper class people have is stable families and support structures which allow them to take greater risks, giving them more opportunity for earnings.

Since this tight knit family structure is also highly valued in many immigrant cultures, even though they are not given the same financial opportunities that middle and upper class Americans are given, immigrants are more likely to be able to take fuller advantage of the opportunities which arise.


Solve the family problem, solve a lot of the poverty/mobility problems as well.

But people don't want to hear that kind of stuff, saying that anyone who's pushing for family is trying to ""morally legislate"" society, but the facts are the facts.

Education plays a part, but family is what dictates quality of education, and family is what dictates the accountability in education. Its not like kids in poor communities are given drastically different opportunities than their lower middle class counterparts.

They get a lot less from their opportunities because they are not held accountable by their families."

cquhbt5&WorldOfWarships&AntiZig&"thank you for clarification, I doubt my isp is at fault here, more likely my lack of understanding the UI.

I get that manual dropping is superior to autodrops, believe me I learned it the hard way when the guy dropped on my kawachi literally 1 km away from the ship leaving me with nothing to do but eat the full spread. So I said okay, let me try the same. Well easier said than done, because for some unknown reason the edge of the dashed circle is not the exact point for the start of their run. Occasionally it will also randomly turn the manual drop in some random direction for no reason (my guess is it somehow locks on and tries to do an auto drop with correcting for target velocity which ends up wrecking the drop anyway).

...eh, never mind my wall of text, I'm rambling. I understand how it works in theory but when it comes to executing in practice the controls are just so imprecise that it's frustrating the hell out of me. more practice needed I'm guessing"

If Laylee is female she could probably use some earrings.  It's somewhat cliche to give bat characters earrings, but it would go a long way in giving her more character, especially since kazooie has pretty noticeable eyelashes to make her look more feminine.

cquhbxv&personalfinance&johnnyringo771&"The trickiest parts I've found with self check out: bringing your own reusable bags, buying produce, buying marked down items, and buying alcohol/restricted items.

There's some simple steps to avoid issues with these, but mainly,  figuring out produce was the hard one for me.  If it doesn't have a sticker on it, write the 4 digit number on your grocery list as you pick it up.  When you get to the check out there will be a produce option,  and an option to type in the code.  Then it'll ask you to weigh it,  or ask for a count.  Some produce is by weight and some is by count.  Good luck! "

cquhbyd&nfl&Slurms_McKenzie775&If Leonord Williams slips to the Falcons I will go the rest of the year without masterbaiting.
cquhbye&fireemblem&Shephen&"I mean he is as bad is you could probably get in PoR without being Bastian or Lucia. His base stats are really terrible and he requires a bexp dump or heavy babying to become useful. The problem with bexp dumping is Marcia joins the same chapter and is more or less 100x more useful at everything. Then there is Mist who has her one moment and is a mounted healer, still pretty bad though but she has something that only she can do. In the next chapter you get Kieran. So there are way better investments when you get him.

Shinon has is early game use where he is practically invincible and can blick just about every enemy. Astrid gets Axes/Lances on promotion which then makes her better than Rolf since she will have 1-2 range and she has access to the knight ward as well. Bows also don't really have a special niche in  FE9, as weapon forging can push any unit into one rounding flying enemies. Also effective damage is 2x I believe in FE9 so they aren't even that powerful against flying enemies. Paladins can also get bows if they chose to, which lets them do Rolf's thing but better thanks to higher move and Sol. But they won't really since they have 1-2 range.

In short Rolf is a unit that needs investment when there are better investments who join at the same time, and what he does after investment isn't anything great or unique and most units can do that and more since they aren't bow locked.

But Bexp dumps and weapon forges fix everything so he can be useable like everyone else in PoR."

cquhbz5&motorcycles&ParticleSpinClass&"I love my 8. It's got it's downsides for city riding (as does *any* inline 4) with it being a little... tempermental at low speeds, but once you get the revs up above 6k, it's got great power. One thing I'd recommend for the low-speed stuff is a G2 throttle tube with a wider cam (to make the throttle more controllable at low throttle positions), and a fuel controller to increase fuel at low rpms (and to trick it into thinking the throttle is open all the time so it doesn't cut fuel and give throttle snatch). 

It's light enough (for me) to be comfortable, and with a few upgrades, it's actually not a bad sport tourer (I've done a few 2000+ mile trips on it). It's a good bike, but needs some serious upgrades to make it a *great* bike (mostly suspension, fueling, and brakes). "

cquhbz8&smashbros&SMarkiii&If you watched the entire set that was linked you would see that the WFT didn't over-rely on the move at all. It was mostly used for recovery from below the stage and horizontally while he also added a lot of mix-ups when recovering from above the stage. At this point in the set the other player probably just lost his nerve from losing the past two games in a pretty one-sided fashion.

cquhbzf&IAmA&Martient712&"I once criticized people for rooting for a meth cook when the show started and I wasn't watching (and was still DARE indoctrinated), but having seen the whole show I have a much different take on the viewer's relationship with Walter. The first episode quite clearly sets up the show as an eventual tragedy in some form, Walters mortality was too real to ignore. As the show progressed and I struggled with my rooting for Walter, I realized what I really wanted. I was rooting for Walter to not become a monster. To keep his humanity. I think he wants that as well. 

The start was the death of Jane I think. He made a call and did an act that even he didn't feel comfortable with, for what he thought was the best interest for Jesse long term, and the viewer even gets to see the beginning of that actually paying off with rehab. But small monstrous acts begin to build up and get closer together and less justified. He keeps it separate for as long as he can, but by the last season he's accepted it and integrated it into himself. I think his final descent into that monster happens a bit too suddenly, as I was still holding hope for him to not be evil by the time the show was no longer leaving room for doubt, but it was still well done. A really solid arc for something that I'm learning evolved pretty dramatically from the beginning. Evidence of even better writing than I was already giving them credit for."

cquhbzm&TheBluePill&KaliYugaz&"What use are these ""generalizations"" and ""trends"", most of which are very weak correlations, in interacting with women on an individual level for seduction purposes?

Of all the poor logic in TRP, this is probably the most perplexing to me. Your entire approach to what you are ostensibly trying to do is completely wrong. The study of general trends in social behavior is only useful to those who are looking to manipulate large groups of people, like governments and advertisers. An average dude looking to get a date or hookup is interacting with women on an *individual* basis, and thus needs information about the specific *individual* being seduced, and the context of that individual's environment, in order to craft a successful seduction strategy. In other words, the intellectual skills required are closer to those of field anthropologists and not of biologists or statisticians.

cquhbzo&gameofthrones&theJavo&"well grrm is basically retelling the war of the roses in fantasy form. It is going to end with the lannisters ""winning"" the war but with out any actual lannister to take the throne and tyrell and a stark union to create the next dynasty. 

I'm just going by the fact that very obviously

lannister = lancaster

stark = york

and tyrell = tudor

but seeing as there is no viable male tyrell yet shown this is seeming less and less likely. 

I think Sansa for sure ends up as someone's queen of convenience married to which ever king ends up on the iron throne as a way to keep the north from rebelling. and that her child starts the next dynasty proper. Maybe Varys is on to something after all. 

she's the mother of Henry the 8th basically. 

basically watch this http://blip.tv/brows-held-high/between-the-lines-game-of-thrones-6803322

it got a lot of insight into the series itself. and once you know who the players represent you can look to actual history to get a pretty good idea of where george is going with this. 

but then again, George promised to introduce a character more terrible and vicious than ""heisenberg"" Walter White before the end, soo all bets are off now if joffery and ramsay don't qualify as such to him. "

cquhbzr&GettingShredded&zeroboot&"This is one of those questions that id hope you'd answer in your research than having to ask. 


I've personally run 200 a day in the hot humid days of South Texas with great success. I have an office job with AC which when combined with having ice water on hand at all times was enough to managed to not visibly sweat. Short walk to the car and then blasting Ac. Paid neighbor kid to mow my yard. AC inside house turned to 72. I also dosed in the evening at about 7 pm and sleep through the peaks. Changed sheets every other day. I did get pretty lethargic and still got very winded. My PPL routine turned into two compound's 3x5 and no isolation. Only managed to walk and slowly jog in intervals for cardio. I drank v8 at least daily for potassium and sodium and drank a lot of water. I felt sweat only when touching things. So if I rested my hands on my legs. Or my legs touched when sleeping. Sitting in my office chair. But it was never enough to leave a mark on my clothing.

I did that for 14 days and lost 9 lbs after the water weight came off. 

I can't speak to how effective 100 would be as I haven't done it. Googling shows a few threads on other boards discussing it. One said 100mg/day raises your metabolism by 11%. The calculus is a per user one though since everyone reacts differently. Balance how bad of sides can you tolerate with how long do you want to suffer them and how much weight do you want to lose. "

cquhc2c&learnprogramming&Rhomboid&"If you want to invent a new language, you write a compiler for that language in another language that already exists.  Once that compiler is stable enough, you rewrite it in the new language and use the previous compiler to compile the new compiler, a process known as bootstrapping.  From that point on, you use the existing version X of the compiler to build the next version X + 1, and you can discard the original compiler written in the other language.  The result is a language and a compiler written in that same language.

C's original compiler was written in assembly before it was bootstrapped.  And the assembler was written in machine language, which is a direct expression of machine instructions and doesn't need a compiler."

No, that's not what people feel immediatedly. It's okay to just like things (unless you are hurting others/yourself). There is no justification and apology needed. Of course that doesn't mean you can't be reflective about it as well (I think this sub is actually pretty good at that) but just embracing the moment and the way something makes you feel right in the moment can in my opinion only be positive."

Part of the cost of the goods goes towards the minimum wage employee, but a large part of it comes from material costs, non minimum wage employees, foreign trade, etc. so the amount of money put into circulation would be more than the inflation. 

Rich people don't want it because their salaries won't raise in comparison. So while the price of the goods increases, their salary won't. 

Plus, the money going towards poor people would be immediately circulated back into the economy, finding its way back to the employer."

By the way, has anyone else had an issue with the caps on the Cult bottles? You can see that on a few of them the outer square cap twisted on the smaller cap inside and now it doesn't line up when the bottle is fully closed. Annoying :/"

Also sports do change rules similarly to patches. You happened to mention Tom Brady,  someone who actually had a rule changed essentially by an incident he was involved in.

Esports have some level of physical requirements, they're just a much smaller sub set of requirements. Calling them athletes is doing a disservice to those who have put in the work to run 4.16 40s and stuff but to act as though LOL Pros don't also put in work to hone skills and physical acumen us unfair.

cquhc7z&IAmA&Butters_Thats_Me&"I dont think joffrey is the worst.. what did he REEEALLY do? besides be an entitled douche? not much.

 Honestly, theres only one person I think is definitely worse than walter white. motherfucking ramsey or whatever his name is.... hes a psychotic motherfucker man hahahahaha. walter didn't do anything really ""fucked up"", i mean he didn't cut anyone's dick off and keep it in a box, while simultaneously torturing and warping said dicklessperson's mind until they are at a point where you can make them your bitch that is so scared of you he never even thinks of disobeying you.

Also i think its totally false what GRRM said. the above point proves it, but even past that, how can walter be worse than the other slave owners who are basically game of thrones hitler status in terms of morality. WW definitely didn't sink that low... he never hurt his family physically besides hank, which he didnt actually kill him, plus he begged for it not to happen. and I think its silly to think nobody in GoT killed their relatives in cold blood.. (im bad at remembering specific GoT stuff, theres probably some pretty obvious people who killed their family gruesomely and are worse than walterwhite)"

cquhc9b&videos&Sklanskers&"I've been researching dash cams for months.. check out [Techmoan](http://www.techmoan.com/).  He reviews all kinds of cameras.. I just bought a [K1S](http://www.techmoan.com/blog/2015/3/1/k1s-the-first-front-rear-hidden-1080p-dash-camera.html).  I'm very pleased with it.  It has a front and rear dash cam @ 1080p or 720p, whatever you want (a little grainy but no complaints).  The audio suffers but that isn't really a desirable feature for me.  On a 64 GB micro sd card you get about 5.5 hours of recording time, at which point it proceeds to overwrite your previous saves (no need to go back and delete videos manually).  You can always hit the ""Emergency record"" button which locks the clip and prevents it from being deleted.  There are options to auto ""emergency record"" if the camera detects a certain amount of ""Gs"" .. basically if you get hit by a car.  Lastly, the cameras are very small (discrete is better imo) and they connect to a small digital ""command unit"" that you can place anywhere.. I'd recommend checking out the link I submitted as the camera has a ton more features as well.. Techmoan has a great review.  A bit on the pricier end.. I got mine for about $225 after shipping."

cquhccs&pics&LilDutchy&"One great thing about a painting like this: Everything is on purpose. 

You may have a scene in a movie that looks like this, or a staged picture, but there will be accidental things. An actor making a lazy face or a hand in any position at all. You make this painting and everything is precisely where it is because you meant for it to tell a story. 

My favorite is right next to the guy getting his head grabbed. The woman seems to be absently moving the cowl of the bearer in front of her to get a better view. Her face has a more curious expression than frantic or urgent like many of the crowd. She's almost a mirror of the woman on the litter. I like to think the person being carried was a decoy for the woman in the crowd, who just kind of wants to see her again to thank her for giving up her life so the other may live.

cquhcd0&AskReddit&sederts&A decent amount, but a lot of job security.
cquhcd1&fatpeoplehate&MJZel&"Let me throw down some science here:

Humans and every other species os meant to have sex and reproduce. All of our bodily functions are meant to keep you alive long enough to procreate, and procreation is the singly most important goal in one's life, biologically speaking. Animals and humans alike must have sex as fast and as frequently as possible to get as many offspring as possible. Not romantic, but it's the biological truth. Therefore, the faster you ejaculate, the *better your body is working.* 
I know we humans like to think there's such a thing as premature ejaculation and lasting longer always equals better, but dicks aren't built to give you orgasms for days; they're built to get in, come, get out, and move on to the next one. Again, humans have evolved to incorporate monogamy and self control and love into their decision making, so it's not literally always like that. But lasting longer means there's something wrong. You're either intoxicated, overweight, have no stamina, have poor blood circulation, or you've jerked it too many times and the nerve endings are not as sensitive. 
So what I'm saying is this: this study *might* be true, but that would only be because the unhealthier you are, the longer you last (with some exceptions, obviously). But I'm even doubtful of this study being empirically valid anyway.
I'm no penis expert, this is me doing my best to understand my physiology and biology classes. 
TL;DR, this study is right because lasting longer is a sign of poor health and fatties are unhealthy. Or it's just completely wrong. "

If you're happy with the fit of your 38Fs, you'd still be a 38F in UK sized brands, though you'll need to be aware of different shapes. I've found Cacique's bras to typically to be average to narrow wire width and fairly projected in shape (except the plunges, which tend to be shallow) with a good underwire firmness.

Panache tends to be about the same width or slightly wider but with much, much taller and firmer underwires. Freya tends to have softer underwires. Elomi and Goddess are often wider and more full coverage. Curvy Kate, IME as narrow and projected was a disaster."

cquhcex&explainlikeimfive&[deleted]&"This kind of word is often said by children. First children learn words individually. They'll learn 'look', then they'll learn 'looked', and treat them like separate words.  Then, they learn rules, like adding 'ed' to the end of a word to make it happen in the past.

Often, you'll hear kids ""overgeneralize"" these rules. They find the word 'looked' because that's the past tense word, then apply the past tense rule to make 'lookeded'.

This also occurs in AAVE (African American Vernacular English) as seen in your videos. I think this is the answer you're looking for.  Using this form of word can show that you're part of the AAVE community. Linguists theorize that it is a hypercorrection - an attempt to correct their regular speech to 'proper English', but overshooting the mark.

I am not satisfied with google docs because i just organize ti in pc folders? What? It would make more sense if a response was like ""doesnt track prices"" or ""does not have custom fields"". I get that you have an ""other"" but I would have to much to add to that.  
  
If this information is all you need, I just feel that the data you get wont be that useful (at least from my perspective)"

I think the color is accurate for the lighting of that pic, by which I mean, in the dark these boots are like a deep brown with some red, but in the light you get much more of that color 8. I'm pretty happy with the color but I have yet to see them in strong daylight, I got them a few hours ago, unboxed them with the camera, wore them half an hour, went out for a run, just got back and it's dark out. Tomorrow!

edit, in the light the panels don't really match, the sides are more red than the toe box. But it's not easy to tell, and the reddish #8 is a great color. I'm psyched to see how these age over time."

cquhcka&FancyFollicles&lilaregenbogen&Aahh the secret: use a shampoo for dyed hair, wash and rinse in cold water, and most importantly, rinse until the water is COMPLETELY clear. If the rinse water is still tinted, that means there is still loose pigment, and that will readily contaminate your other colours. Once out out the shower, immediately squeeze as much water as you can out, then wrap it in a towel, then swap for another towel after a few minutes, then maybe a third. Drying it faster means less time for further loose pigment to transfer. This will also prevent you from staining your pillow cases and shirt collars!

Now, I co-wash once every day or two, S2C, and comb, not brush. I also use a little bit of gel before plopping overnight. I never knew what to do with my hair, and while I'm not 100% satisfied, I know I'm on the right path!"

Also, I'm a fan of the vivint sky app aesthetics, and find it to work well; ideally though, I'd love to have the 2gig panel as a secondary zwave controller, but it seems vivint has that thing too locked down for that.

You're right it definitely hasn't been running under 30fps but it doesn't seem to be above 55 either. Another thing to consider is that when looking at the livestreams that have been around the past few days you have to remember that twitch's quality settings might be a bottleneck in some cases considering the pc that they're streaming from has to be able to handle above 30fps. Derrik from GameXplain was streaming two days ago and he said even though the game is running higher than 30fps, that's the max we'll see because his pc can't handle anything higher

Lebron is 2/5 right now... he's lost more than he won and needs to win a lot more. What if he ends up 4/8?  I would take 6/6 over 4/8 every time.  But if LBJ ended 6/10, which means he goes 4/5 from now forward... and he has two more repeats or a threepeat, then I could seriously include him in the GOAT conversation.

2.) I had some issues when setting up my accounts with VB, but it was resolved with a phone call to their customer service.

I believe he mentions that he was originally in Squad 4 and that he hopes his talents have waned too much since then. Clearly, he was a stellar healing-kido user back then. 

I hope that he trained his healing Kido from FKT and on and maybe even became quite adept at it allowing him to save himself after being ""gutted"" like he was.

cquhcvg&AskReddit&the_cox&"I was told by my math teacher in 6th grade to not pursue math, and I overheard her speaking to a colleague saying that I was a clear candidate for the lowest level Math class we offered in high school.

End of the year, I got an award from the state for getting one of the highest scores on the state math competition, repeatedly, over the three or four months that we filled out the tests for them.  So, yeah, take that, Mary.

Not only that, but in high school, I am not in the lowest level math course, I am taking the highest level of physics (something my first year physics teacher told me not to pursue) and also the highest level of Chemistry.  I even received honorable mention on the state chapter of the American Chemical Society's Chemistry Olympiad.

Despite this, and the fact that I am in the most challenging high school in my city, in the most challenging classes available to me, and am not doing poorly in them, I was denied from Purdue Engineering.  Oh well, I have backups, and that wasn't my ultimate goal.  Their loss."

cquhcvi&worldnews&squidbillie&"That actually bothered me at first.

I'm going to go with irony here. The only thing that would lead me to casual/convenient racism is the gypsy nonsense surrounding Klinger. However, that character wore it with pride, commonly referring to themselves similarly; we didn't get to know Spearchucker Jones well enough to know where and what that origin story of the name was, so safe bet is to align it with similar.

Basically we have a set of characters whose backstory and Nick names were defined throughout the show (obviously radar and explaining his name to the new colonel after the horrific cause to the change in leadership), and Mr Jones simply never made it to that depth. So comparing them to the characters who did I am going to assume there was a fitting story in there.

I think he actually chucked spears in college. Like Olympic javelin stuff. So irony all the way. I don't recall that from the show, though, so I might have read that somewhere unofficial. In either case the evidence says that we would have found out a great reason but we were simply never afforded the opportunity.

Edit: thanks for even bringing it up. Googled, wikipedia says he chucked spear as a sport in either high school or college."

Same triangular build and material. I see a hole open in the top and a ball drops in. Instead of falling, the ball circles around the sphere as it slowly comes down. The second I look away from the ball, I look across from me to see one of those scrambler rides. The ones that spin its arms in a circle while three seats attached to the arms also spin in a circle but in the opposite direction. On it, is a damn marionette. It's dressed as a cowboy and aims a shiny gun at me and right as he's about to fire it, I look for that ball again. It's feet away from me and it's about twice as big as I am. The puppet fires his gun and the ball smashes into me. I wake up and I am full on sick. This dream I have had every time I come down with anything more than a cold. The first time was when I was 6 and had pneumonia.

cquhcwm&LawSchool&IIIlllIII1&"Law school is a game (a VERY hard one, obviously) and part of it is to hype up the difficulties to new potential students.

Ask yourself these two questions: do you want to be a lawyer? And are you willing to spend three years of your life studying when you could be earning income?

If you do your homework and answer ""yes,"" then disregard everything else. If you are willing to throw away three years of income to become a lawyer, the workload shouldn't concern you. It's hard as hell, but if you truly want to be a lawyer then it won't be miserable. And it pales in comparison to the financial sacrifice (lost wages plus tuition and living expenses) that you know you're incurring when you walk in.

If 1) you have an idea of what it means to be a lawyer, 2) you're aware of the financial investment, and 3) *you still want it*, you shouldn't be scared off by horror stories."

cquhcwy&nba&stormstopper&"Halftime Four Factors

Factor | Bulls | Bucks
------|-----|-----
EFG% | 59.2% | 39.4%
OREB% | 27.3% | 04.8%
TO% (est.) | 14.1% | 20.2%
FT Rate | 14.3 | 36.4

I did these Four Factors breakdowns for some Duke games on /r/collegebasketball because I like to see what some of the stats say about the game, and whether it agrees with my eyes. Here, it basically confirms everything we're seeing: the Bulls are shooting really well and the Bucks aren't, the Bulls are doing a lot better on the offensive glass than the Bucks, and the Bulls aren't turning it over as much. But what I don't think gets captured is the percentage of opportunities that the Bulls are converting compared to the Bucks. The Bulls are outscoring the Bucks 15-1 off of turnovers, which exacerbates the disparity in turnover rate. They're 7-7 from the line to the Bucks' 7-12, neutralizing the Bucks' advantage in free throw rate. That's just my two cents."

Typically towers are captured so you can spawn up there when you die.

cquhd0z&relationships&Luckyducks&First, check to see if there are any practical things she would like help with. There are likely things her ex did that she will now be responsible for on top of everything else. She may appreciate someone doing those things until things smooth over a bit. When I was in the process of getting a divorce it was really helpful to me to have people just spend time with me. You go from being with someone to being alone and that can be overwhelming. Often friends would come by to watch movies or play cards. This helped transition me into getting used to being on my own. Another thing is that all of a sudden a lot of your life becomes focused on the divorce. I really appreciated people who made an effort to include me in things where we didn't have to talk about it. If she feels up for it maybe you and your husband can meet her and the kids at a park to play or do something fun. As a fellow introvert I know it can be hard to initiate. I was really surprised who stepped in to be there for me and who wasn't. I developed really close bonds to people I didn't really feel close to before and years later they are some of my best friends.

cquhd1d&Overwatch&TheHappyRage19&"Symmetra (teleport) seems like a must have at some stage of games, in particular when travel time from spawn is detriment to returning to the action. Other than that, each hero shines in different situations and without actually play testing and looking only at base skill kits without knowing the numbers on skills, I'd say every hero has a place in the competitive scene at this stage but we won't know till he have numbers, learn maps and all that stuff.

I'm sure if Blizzards internal stats reveal that ""Hero X"" isn't being used at all in high level play. They will look and adjust him till he fits. Keep in mind that some heroes seem to shine in different situations but those situations might be rare in competitive play. I'd be happy if there were heroes that didn't get played much but when that unique situation occurs, someone swaps to that underused hero to take advantage of the situation to get ahead, but in an ideal world we would like to see every hero getting some play even if its only for a minute or two in 1 out of 10 games."

Yellowstone to Seattle is good. Goes through some beautiful country. I wont critique the last leg, since you mentioned you'll adjust. 

Few tips-US National Park system is great. Usually pretty roads with excellent asphalt. Can’t go wrong including them on a long trip. Also [MotorcycleRoads.com](http://www.motorcycleroads.com) is a good guide to find nice roads. As example, they show some between Fayetteville and El Dorado, but I haven't been on them, so I didn't put on map I routed."

cquhd3p&Welding&tubehand&"I have a house out west, in a union state. But work there is little to none...
Its all DOD clean rooms. Which pay really good, and the welding is simple,  Its just overlay on weird parts... for werid things, and simple fabrication, and some but welds, but nothing tight ya kno? No heaters, pipe racks, working in the elements.  I mean making but welds on a engine piping for a rocket in an air conditioned room sounds like a dream.

 I also have a home in the texas/LA area.
But i would really love to be back home. home is home ya kno.
Iv been on the road for way to long.. and im thankful for my opportunities and all.
But they basically told me Back out west. That i am not a journeymen, and would have to do a 2-5 year apprenticeship. They also said to get in the union you need union experience.. i was like WTF. I told them i was a journeymen, and that I weld severe cycle lines in the refineries. On inconel, monel, duplex, alloy x, Ti, in convection boxes, ethelne heaters, crackers, Pipe racks. Ect.
They gave me an interview, asked me my current average wage.. Now looking back i should have lied. Set me up for a weld test.. Which were so simple. super heavy wall combo test on carbon. And a 2 inch heavy wall inconel test. No restricter jigs, no pipe rack test, no box test. ect...
They said, well, we can start you off as a level 3 apprentice.  I said thats bullshit, because your ""journeymen"" welders you have would never make it past the first weld in a refinery or a powerhouse.

As you kno, their is a big difference between making a weld in jack stands, and making one in the field. 

id join the union, 433 would be nice, but i cant stand the humidity and miss the mountains.  Just as you would prob miss the bayou, lakes n rivers

cquhd4k&AskReddit&HardlyWood&"My ex boyfriend (we stayed very much in touch) passed away less than a year after we broke up. He was going through a divorce and had two children when we dated. I connected with some of his lifelong friend after his passing, and learned quite a few things about him.  

From patchy comments and stories he would never fully elaborate on, we pieced together a history of rape by his father from a very young age. 

I also learned that he was essentially entrapped by his wife. He had been friends with her as a teenager (he was 40 when he passed) and she was obsessed with him. She got pregnant with their first child because she stopped taking her birth control, and she convinced him to marry her. From what his best friends say, he never really loved her. But when we dated, he told his friends all about me.  Throughout him begging me to go out with him, through our on-again, off - again relationship, he was totally smitten with me.  Even at his memorial service, his wife said he would have done anything to be with me. His father introduced me as his true love.  He always told me ""you don't understand"".  I've never felt as completely loved by anyone before or since him.  
But honestly, I hope he gets some peace now.  He was truly a tortured soul, and did any kind of substance to dull the pain. Even though his two wonderful children are without their father, they have an amazing mother to love and support them, and they don't have to go through the constant tumult of his life. 
I miss him. "

cquhd4m&AskReddit&w3woody&"In the second grade I got the same thing.

Graduated from Caltech.

And funny story about that: I went up to my guidance councilor to give her the good news about my being accepted in Caltech. (I had been accepted by their early acceptance program, meaning I knew in January that I was going.) And when I told her that I had been accepted, but before I could show her the letter, she told me to stop being stupid and applying for an impossible school--that I would be better off applying to Fresno State and then eventually maybe transferring to a University of California school--but not Berkeley because that's too hard to get into.

I looked at her, showed her the letter, informed her that she had mis-heard--that I had been **accepted** and not just applied, then after she read the letter and looked up at me, I looked her in the eye and said ""fuck you,"" and left. Never interacted with her after that."
cquhd4n&landscaping&Sarudin&"I think you are overestimating how difficult it is to maintain a flower bed that is properly set up. I have a few suggestions to make this flower bed much more maintenance free than the grass.

1. Start with a bed that doesn't have weeds. This bed is probably too far gone to save. I would pull out your favorite plants and use roundup on all of the rest.

2. You need to have good boarders to help maintain a barrier between the grass and flower bed. Rocks do not make good boarders because they do not prevent grass from creeping under them. Check out the double brick boarder that I linked below. If you dig down a bit and have sand under this boarder the grass will never get into your landscape. It also prevents the mulch from getting into your lawn. This boarder is also nice because your flowers can hang over without getting in the way of the mower. There are other boarders like this but the idea is to have it deep enough to prevent grass from being able to run under.
https://billwandsnider.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/nelson.jpg

3. Get a good 3"" of mulch in there and you will find that you have much less of an issue with weeds. You probably never mulched heavily before because it would fall out because of your boarder problem. 

4. Always use a pre-emergent weed preventer like Preen early in the Spring to prevent weeds. Combine this with the mulch and your weeding time will be less than mowing the area by far.

5. Plant native perennial plants in your bed.These will generally require less maintenance and watering. If you get 4-6 hours of direct sunlight then plant shaded plants. 6+ hours will work for full sunlight plants. The sun is not strong in the morning so sunlight time before 9:00 AM is negligible. 

6. Put down a high quality tarp under the mulch to further prevent weeds."

* Cotton Guard
* Belly Drum
* Drain Punch
* Play Rough

After setting up one cotton guard, non-STAB physical steel attacks rarely endanger it. If you can get two cotton guards and a belly drum, the game is basically over. Drain Punch keeps your HP up, and Unburden gives effective 486 speed as long as you don't get Whirlwinded out.

cquhd8n&Survival&Crunkbutter&"Aside from the obligatory knife and para cord, this is what I would fit in that ammo box.

-Headlamp 

**Shelter/fire:**  
- Tarp. Find a cheap one wherever you can. Just make sure it's large enough to cover you and has metal grommets.  
- Poncho and space blanket.  Space blankets aren't made for insulation, but they can block the wind and reflect radiation, which is useful for fire shields. Also, they don't take up much space or weight so there's no point in not bringing it. Just don't make it your only tool for staying warm.  
- Bic lighter. They don't break as easily as the cheap kind. If you want to practice with firesteel though, definitely bring some along. The lighter is just a better first option.  
- (optional) Fire starting tablets. They're not totally necessary, but they're nice in a pinch and they give you a long flame in case it's wet out.

**Water**  
- Small stainless steel water bottle with a carabiner. For boiling and carrying water obviously. Pack items in the bottle to conserve space in the ammo case.  
http://www.amazon.com/Klean-Kanteen-Stainless-Bottle-Sports/dp/B009W7F75U/ref=pd_bxgy_sg_img_y  
Here's a 12 oz one as an example. You can probably find a similar size at Goodwill for a few bucks.  
-Iodine tablets. In case you can't get a fire going, you can have potable water in about a half hour. Just bring some powdered electrolyte drink like Gatorade to cover the taste.  

**First Aid:**    
-Bandaids  
-Alcohol wipes.  
(optional) gauze and a small roll of medical tape. The tape can actually be really useful in other ways. Get creative.

**Travel:**  
-A compass and small pencil to mark the map.

**Other if space available:**  
- A pair of socks in a plastic bag. You never know when a nice dry pair of socks could come in handy. Plus, you can turn them into a makeshift water filter for dirty water.  
- A small roll of trash bags with ties. Many uses.  Doesn't take up much space.  
-Spork

cquhd8q&wwesupercard&wweRubberDucky&i was just addressing the 3MB/EX pulls question as noone else had, although it is a very unbalanced deck, over a 3 match game with card control and having more higher cards than lower its a necessary tactic that works well. A lot of people use the word unbalanced here when talking about RTG decks when what they really mean is too many weak cards, having 14 great cards and 6 weak ones is unbalanced but shouldnt slow you down too much, whereas vice versa it will make a big difference as the few great ones drag the others into a higher level than they can beat far sooner, meaning far longer grinding +1s for lower cards (switching to uncommon method is usually better here with this kind of deck) so going back to my first reply, its better to do that to balance out the middle of the team without moving up as quick for balance as opposed to stretching your deck with 1 higher level card that wont help in EX/KOTR and makes it harder for the back end of your RTG deck

cquhd8z&BF_Hardline&ChaoticNeutralCop&Personally I would like to see Enforcer get Fast Swap like mechanic does. Because the pistols(beagle) are so good, and shotguns currently so buggy, being able to use my pistol as my main long range engagement gun has been a necessity. Reduced fall damage could disappear from all classes and no one would miss it, when you can pull your parachute ripcord 5 meters from the ground and never take any fall damage. The Rep perks need an overhaul over all 4 classes for sure, and I agree Enforcer isn't offering the team much currently with ammo being its only draw and mechanic taking its crown as the CQC king due to shoddy shotgun hit lag :( Give us a reason to play enforcer Visceral!

If she wants to, she'll let him have some of it.

It makes sense if she's at home since she's the one who's going out and buying things that keep people alive.

My beef with this was more about context. Sponsored by a college, it stands to reason that it's probably only going to be read by college students. In that case the target demographic probably isn't married and shackled to an oven at home. That comes later /s.

Also, I wouldn't call it abusive to not provide somebody with money to spend when they can't earn it themselves and would therefore need to ask you to give it to them. I'd call it an asshole thing to do but not abusive whether some pointy forehead at some university agrees or not. It assumes that most women are incapable of retaliating which is kinda super duper stupid. Most women will react pretty naturally by saying something like ""No money for me ? Okay...no motorboating for you."" Seems fair. 

In any case, I'm pretty sure we're mainly talking about college students here which is why I stand by my original statement."

I frequented them all the time just to have fun in the dungeons. Once max/comp released that *entire* niche group died out. ""xp waste"" was never a mainstream thing, ever, until those capes came along.

cquhda2&WritingPrompts&universe_fabric&"""Nothing yet."" I cursed as I stared out the passenger window of our car. Houses, streets, and children playing passed by.
 
""Well, just relax, don't anticipate,"" answered my wife, Natalie. ""The doctor said we won't know when you'll remember something, but you will. It will just happen."" I love my wife. I don't know how she can love a man with such baggage, but I won't question it. I must be doing something right.
 
My earliest memories are of being in an orphanage. I guess I just kind of... came to one day. I had no memory of how or why I was there. I was suddenly 12 years old, with no explanation. The people who ran the place wouldn't even answer my questions. So I dealt with it; Dealt with the anxiety, the lack of love and answers. The only family we as orphans had was the staff, but to them, we were just a job.
 
Natalie pointed to a house on the right side of the street. It was two stories and looked like all the others. ""There, 498. The doctor said that was your house when you were little. And that,"" she pointed to a house on the left side of the street now, ""that is 503, our new house!""
 
I sighed, a little heavier than I'd intended. I was getting impatient with myself. When will I remember something? ""Will you drive around a bit more? Maybe something will spark my memory. We can get used to the streets a bit more, too.""
 
""Certainly, sweetie,"" My wife, my rock. The doctor says I have been improving. He suggested that we move back to where I lived as a child, before the orphanage. Maybe it will get those juices flowing. The actual house I lived in is occupied and expensive. We ended up buying one across the street, regardless of the murders; It was cheaper that way.
 
Thirty minutes later we pulled into our new driveway. ""Well, here we are,"" she announced cheerfully.
 
At the same moment, my phone vibrated. A text from the movers. It read: Small detour. Will be an hour late. ""The movers got lost, say they'll be an hour late. Let's go see where we want to put the furniture."" I opened the door to get out. As I put my right foot on the cement, a sharp pain went through my head. Immediately my hand flew to my forehead for comfort. ""Ouch!""
 
 ""What's wrong?"" Natalie asked with more than a hint of worry in her voice.
 
""Nothing, just a pain in my head."" I tried to sound casual, but it hurt a lot. I don't think I fooled her. ""Listen,"" she gently took my chin in her hand and turned my face to look at hers. ""If at any point this gets too much..."" I kissed her. ""You'll be the first to know."" She released my face, and we made our way to the door.
 
I rubbed my forehead as she unlocked the door. The pain had turned into a dull ache that seemed to grow slightly as we had approached the door. ""I hope that wasn't a bad omen.""
 
She reprimanded me. ""That's enough of that talk."" She swung open the door and crossed the threshold. ""I love the layout so much!"" Straight ahead was the staircase, to the right, the kitchen, and to the left, the living room. She chose to explore the kitchen again.
 
I crossed the threshold myself, and felt it again. Again my hand shot to my head for comfort. With her back to me, she couldn't see me grimace. I wonder if this is how Harry Potter felt when his thoughts linked to Voldemort. The sharp pain turned to a dull ache now. That I can handle. I could hear my wife in the kitchen, mentally placing our appliances on the counter. ""Toaster there, microwave here...""
 
I made my way over to her. Just as did, the pain receded. Curious, I stepped in front of the staircase. The ache came back. I don't like where this is going. It made me extremely curious, though, and unleashed a fury of questions. I can tough this out. I had to follow this pain trail.
 
First step. Aching grew worse. Second step. Still worse. The pain seemed to increase by the same amount each time. I wonder how long until I can't stand it anymore. I hate headaches, and this pain was enveloping by brain with each step. ""Nat? Can you come here, Nat?""
 
""What's wrong?"" I heard her voice and foot steps before I saw her. ""Are you okay?""
 
""Yes, it's just... Could you please follow me upstairs? I'm getting this tremendous pain in my head. It gets worse the more I go upstairs. I'm a little worried, honestly.""
 
""Okay, of course."" She followed me as I took the stairs one at a time. Each step continually made the pain worse. It's like I'm playing a torturous game of 'hot and cold.' Each step lead to compounding pain.
 
Finally, the second floor. I kept going. Natalie caught up with me just outside the master bedroom. ""How are you doing?""
 
""It's bad,"" I told her. ""Pretty bad. I need to keep going though. There's something in there for me, I know it."" 
 
""I trust you'll know when to stop? I don't want you to have an aneurysm.""
 
""Yea. I won't let that happen."" The door was open, giving me a chance to look around at the inside. Nothing seemed to give away any clues. The closet was my obvious choice, then. ""Here we go,"" I sucked in a deep breath, anticipating the pain.  I was not disappointed. One more step. ""Oohh shit,"" half way through the step the pain in  my head reached unbearable portions.  I fell backwards, throwing one hand out to catch myself on the wall. She was by my side before i could say ""That was too much, ouch.""

""Sit."" And she helped me sit. ""I'll check the closet."" 

When I took that half a step back, the added pain went away. I was back to a barely tolerable level. My head throbbed as I watched Natalie carefully make her way to the closet. I fought the pain as I watched her sloooowly opened the door. From my angle, I couldn't see anything worthwhile. Nothing scary, nothing out of the ordinary. 

""Its looks like..."" her thought trailed off as her brain worked to figure something out. ""It's almost as if this wall was re-wallpapered. Poorly, I might add. If I could just..."" The sound of peeling wallpaper filled my ears. ""Ha! Got it! And oh, oh my...""

""What is it?"" I tried to sound urgent, fighting to talk through the pain in my head. 

""Come here,"" she said, sounding distracted. 

Not thinking it through, I tried to stand and move toward her, only to be knocked back on my ass. I scooted out of the room, The pain abated appropriately. I was still left with a pounding, aching head. ""Take a picture, bring it here."" I heard the camera on her phone snap a picture. Next thing I knew she was at my side, phone held out for me to see. I stared at the picture, trying to make sense of it. 

What the pictured captured was a lot of handwriting, on old, peeling paint, unlike any colors I'd seen in the house so far. The first line was clearly written by an adult. It read: My score ~~1~~  ~~2~~  ~~3~~  ~~4~~  ~~5~~  6. Under that, 6 names. They looked to be written in children's handwriting, each one in a style all its own. ~~Johnny Smith~~  ~~Nicole Bruster~~  ~~Angela Cohen~~  ~~William Ida~~  ~~Susie Atwood~~ 

The pain in my head suddenly vanished as I read the last name on the list. *My* name ~~Christopher Russell~~

Lots of people are saying ""it's ok to kill them and milk them but not fuck them?"". Yeah, I can sort of identify with the hypocrisy but we are talking about the custom of eating to survive and that is far different than just fucking a goat cause you want to. They are two different concepts

4. I could see someone going Cutlass first, but I personally would never do it. I 100% always rush Static Shivv just because of the huge damage spike.

I think you may also benefit from considering that do many things about pregnancy are really out of our control. It concerns me when you say that you will ""only gain the minimum doctor recommended amount."" This really sounds like you are setting yourself up for disappointment.

cquhdcy&KerbalSpaceProgram&KlingonAdmiral&"It's realistic, though. Actual space programs don't engineer for optimal flight performance, they engineer for optimal cost performance. And the basic rule is ""engines expensive, fuel cheap"", leading to as much fuel as possible to be put atop an engine. Also, seeing a gigantic rocket slowly ascent from the pad just looks epic.

For instance, the first stage (boosters included) of the Ariane 5 (GS variant) produces a thrust of 15,175 kN at liftoff with a liftoff mass of 777,000 kg. Liftoff TWR of 1.9. The core burns about 231 kg of fuel per second. After the boosters burn out after 140s, it has lost 546 tons in it's boosters, and 32.34 tons in it's core stage, leaving the total mass at 198.66 tons. Thrust goes down to 1,015 kN, bringing TWR down to a whopping 0.5. My rockets never fall into negative twr during ascent, so I lowered launch twr to adjust."

cquhdde&AskReddit&kinkachou&"Europeans tend to have a ""pure-bred"" sort of look. This is changing now as there is increased immigration into European nations, but in the case of people whose families have been living in one country for hundreds of years, they tend to look very much like their countrymates. 

Americans tend to be mutts, mixed from all the people who immigrated to America over the years. Most white people are combinations of Irish, British, German, French, Italian, and a bunch of others they don't even know. If you look at them and try to guess their ancestry it will be pretty hard, since they look like a mix. 

TL;DR: If you can't tell where someone is from, they're American. If they're white and have a strong look that reminds you of people from a certain country, they're probably European. "

cquhdg4&Naruto&ImAnAppleBiteMe&"Doesn't madara say something like if you had aimed a little higher you would have killed me.. Or something like that. You can't have guy beat the ""main"" villain, that would be dumb when the show is about Team 7.

Addition:

Thats what I mean by plot. Eight gates guy was very capable of doing it but wasn't allowed to because the series was ending and Madara was the main villain at the time. It had to be like that, I'm not saying it was a problem like plot armor, but that's just how this stuff works. I would actually be kinda upset if madara killed naruto and sasuke and then guy sacrificed himself to end madara. Like seriously if that was the ending I would shed a few man tears for kakashi."

cquhdgg&GlobalOffensive&SLTRMaverick&"Sounds like you've got most of it figured out dude :)

For your questions:

Aim maps are really good for practising aim (no shit, right?) but they don't help you learn how to move around the actual competitive maps or how to hold good angles on them. So basically aim maps are good to do but DMs will also help you learn the maps really well so it doesn't hurt to throw some of those in.

For maps I would look up the competitive map pool for ESEA (cache/d2/mirage/inferno/overpass/train/cbble) and learn those maps pretty well. First time on the map I would do offline by yourself and maybe google a callout map so you can learn what the callouts are and the basic layout of the map. For really intimately learning the maps it's mostly comes down to just PUGing and playing on them. Learning the smokes is pretty important for competitive play. There are websites to help you with smokes like [http://www.thewarmup.net/](http://www.thewarmup.net/).

Bhops are pretty useless in competitive. If you're really good at it then you can move a bit faster but it can slow you down if you do it wrong (and they're really hard to do) so it's usually not worth it. Bhopping can be fun though, so learn it if you like :)

cquhdgi&AskReddit&cepheid22&When I was a child, I had a recurring dream where my parents were divorced. My Dad lived in a trailer. There was a monster that lived outside near his trailer. Whenever my sister and I would visit the trailer, the monster would come looking for us. Sometimes, I'd be stuck outside with the sky black and red flowers all around waiting for the monster to find me.

cquhdh5&AskReddit&KANNABULL&I use to think it was odd at first until my two year old niece would kiss me goodbye and I made a big deal about her kissing me on the lips.

There is an age when it gets inappropriate though and I started kissing her on the cheek and forehead at around five when I would drop her off for school.

Like when that female astronaut went crazy, Lisa Nowak.

If a male astronaut went crazy like that, no one would be using thinking that men shouldn't be astronauts."
