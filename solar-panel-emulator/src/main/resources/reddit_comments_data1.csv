A contracter contracted out a security guard recently at my job that was in his 60's.  Not a bad guy, and his job wasn't hard.  The contractors set up a video camera to do their repair, he just had to make sure they complied with the video camera (signing off on each video and repair), and he had to keep track of keys.

Well, the old man put 67 keys into 67 'security envelopes', with the specific customers account number located inside the security envelope.

Whereas other builds that aren't adc like Warrior Tabi, Ichi, Exe, can get Oddy 4th item.
cqugh7j&explainlikeimfive&stairway2evan&"Well, first off, how the sport works:

Two guys compete for up to 12 rounds of 3 minutes each.  They're only allowed to punch (no kicks, knees, elbows, or wrestling holds) and can only hit above the belt.  They're given points by several judges based on how well they performed in each round - mostly landing punches or defending well.

You either win by the judges' points after 12 rounds, or by knocking the other guy down so that he can't get up in a 10-count, or by the referee or the other guy's team deciding that the guy can't safely fight anymore.

So now, as for this fight's importance.  Mayweather is considered by most to be the best boxer in the world - several titles, currently undefeated in his professional career.  Pacquio (who is Filipino) is also considered one of the best in the world - several titles over a long career.  But these two fighters have never gone against each other - ever since 2009, people have been hoping they'd fight, but they never managed to agree on payment, drug testing, etc until now.

So now you've got an undefeated champion going up against a guy who's been considered either the second-best boxer on earth or considered ""maybe even better than Mayweather, but he hasn't gotten to prove it yet.""

So if you're in a Filipino house, stick with the people and cheer for Manny Pacquiao.  He's the underdog in the odds, but not by too big a margin.  I'm hoping for a good fight."

The rest of their demos are worth watching.  I'm not sure what their technology is, but since it's Kontakt based, it's got to be samples - but each horn must be made up of like 250 well-cross faded samples.

cqugh9y&Velo&0_0_7&He has studies that he cites in it, dunno what the arguments are for not being up on carbs. I tend to believe lots of carbs are crucial, if I'm not eating a lot of carbs per day and during rides (even stuff like 2.5 hour Z2/Z3) I can often smell ammonia which means I've gone into amino metabolism and I'm breaking down muscle.  I think theres people who argue for riding a purely aerobic levels and not eating much in the way of carbs to 'make the body want to use fat for energy more' ...I've experimented quite a bit with that: at a pace in which I've never gone into amino metabolism for 3+ hours is... slow. It's so slow it becomes a waste of time really...I guess if you have 6 hours to tool around it might be worth it, doubt it gives any benefit for fitness however.

I usually gain weight when I live abroad in western countries because the portions are huge (like 2-3 times Indonesian portions) and my stomach gradually adjusts to the point where I need the bigger portions to feel satisfied.

Also, yes we drink a lot of sweet things, but we still mostly drink water. It's a lot worse in countries with serious obesity problems. There are people out there who don't drink water ever and would exclusively drink soda or fruit juices, which have tons of sugar in them."

However, since fatness correlate with a lack of education and low-income (in many ways fatness is a matter of class) I think that maybe there are better ways to be attacking this health problem. "

I also had a $5 pledge level on my own campaign that brought in 63 backers and that is 63 people that I can contact for future kickstarter projects and keep in the loop of the things that I do.

IMO I think a solid pledge level that costs under $5 is worth it for any campaign. Offer things that you already are making but in a digital version. Find ways of incorporating them into your project without causing extra costs for yourself and you are golden!"

Another bias prevalent in reddit is when a news story get posted that says Asians are better at math than whites. Then all this horde of people comes out of nowhere saying how they study specifically for the test, that test score does not reflect actual math aptitude, followed by the anecdotes ""my chinese coworker is a PhD in Math, and he's dumb"".

cqughdc&AirForce&meepketo&"As silly as awards feel, and as much as the humble Airmen often don't care about (and may even resist) formal recognition, it is important to understand how important awards can be in a long-term career.  As we move into the new EPR system where only 15% can be 4s or 5s, it will be those awards that set you apart (or don't) from other Airmen.  If you ever want to do special duties, those awards will set you apart.  If you ever want to make SMSgt, those awards will set you apart.

And awards build awards.  You get coined, then you win a monthly, then you win a quarterly, then you win a yearly, and then these other awards come up and your supervisor already knows you're competitive AND has the package over half done from writing your previous awards.  Roll with it and good things can come of it.  Remember this when you're a supervisor too.  Your Airmen that don't know will need someone to look out for them, and of course, it isn't uncommon to use subordinate awards as one-of-many metrics to measure NCOs and SNCOs.  A SNCO who can show a pile of awards their subordinates have received is clearly doing something right  for their people."

If they say no, ask for their supervisor or higher up. If they insist they do no have have such a person, ask who else you can speak to. Or insist they do, and maybe repeat the original script.

Then continue with whomever you get transfered to. You may go in circles. Write down the names of the people you speak to. Be polite. You may go around more than once, and you don't want them to hang up

I pulled a full weekend this one time. Got to know a few people. Built some rapport. They ultimately put me in touch with a technician who solved my problem. He was confused and weirded out.  But the thing continues to be fixed.

One kid was overly affectionate/didn't do well with rejection, another was set off by not completing his ""circuit"" during play time, one had a very hard time with transitions, etc. To me it's the kind of question that acknowledges kids are individuals and you have a mild interest in hers at least.

cqughgd&vancouver&iknowwhereiam&"I was born in North Van. 

My parents went to Carson Graham together in highschool. My Dad was born in Chilliwack but moved around a bit as his Dad was in the army. They ended up in North Van, and when his parents split his mom rented places all over the North Shore. His family history is pretty predominantly Canadian going back a few generations to settlers in Ontario and Quebec.

My Mom was born in Winnipeg, shortly after her parents immigrated here from the UK. They moved around a ton while my Grandad looked for work (Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, BC). They eventually bought a house of Capilano Road in 1973, and moved out that same house 2012. They still live in North Van.

My folks left North Van in 1989, they could afford to buy a house in North Van or my Dad could finish his Master's Degree but not both. They did however stay within a couple hours of Vancouver to stay close to family.

I lived in North Van for exactly 2 years of my life (1987-1989), I grew up just outside of Vancouver, spent university on Vancouver Island, and moved back to Burnaby for 1 year in 2010. When I was offered 2 jobs (1 in downtown Vancouver, and one on Vancouver Island) I jumped ship because they paid the same but my quality of living would be shit in Vancouver, and I'd never be able to afford a house. Do I regret it? A little, I'd love to live there, but this way I'll be able to buy a house one day."

Just back out, invite the people in the lobby who do meet your specifications to your fireteam and search again. It's really that simple.

Hello Scotchit! Here to review the Ledaig 10 today. Bottled 46.3% ABV, I took notes with both a Glencairn and my larger bodied Canadian Glencairn.

**Nose**: salty caramel, fresh tilled earth, lemons

The Canadian gave more presence to the eathy notes of this one and subdued the others somewhat

**Palate**: salt, some caramel, more salt

What happened? I was looking forward to earthy lemony caramel... 

**Finish**: Lemon followed by salt, after letting it open (30+minutes) a touch of the earthiness I was hoping for earlier

This is not the dram I was looking for.... Great start with the nose, but all that salt afterwards... I won't be buying this one again. **50**/100"

If you really want to save money avoid living downtown. uOttawa, Carleton, Algonquin, and St Paul's all include a mandatory bus pass in the tuition and you can get around fine using the bus. At uOttawa, anyways, tons of kids commute from their parents' houses in the 'burbs. It's not the funnest thing in the world, but not living downtown can save you a lot of money. I'm not saying live a 2 hr bus ride away, but even living just not ""in walking distance to school"" can be a big money saver. Also think about getting a job if you can! I know a lot of degrees are hella demanding (shoutout to the 3rd year engineering kids who have 7 courses/semester!) time-wise, but if you think you can manage it, look into it! Schools offer a lot of part-time job options for students and they're great about accommodating your schedule and being ok with you being gone during breaks and the like.

The only issue you might have going back to the 2TB backup is programs. Most programs installed to the 4TB will also make registry changes on the SSD's installation. If you then not from the 2TB drive then those registry values won't exist and programs that depend on those values won't run.

My suggestion, after the SSD is up and running, wipe the 2TB drive, make an image of your SSD, and store it on the 2TB or 4TB drive. Then, if the SSD dies or the OS gets hosed you can just restore that image. Periodically remake the image so it doesn't fall to far behind.

Also, sign up for DropBox or GoogleDrive and save your important documents in the cloud. They will be automatically synched so you have an off-site, professionally-managed backup of critical documents."

I had depression during the first portion of my college years and ended up flunking a lot of classes. I was placed on academic probation and was seeing a counselor for suicidal tendencies and self harm. This was a drastic change from high school, where I was rank #2 out of my entire class and had full ride scholarship offers. I was able to make positive changes very slowly and eventually improved my grades. I had to retake a lot of courses of course but I still graduated on time by taking summer courses. I remember feeling as if I had ruined my entire life already so why now remove myself from the equation? Please believe me when I say your life isn't ruined. You'll be able to pay these bills off. You can work things out with your school. Your parents and friends are there for you to lean on for support. Just take it one step at a time. All of these problems can be fixed. The only thing that can't be fixed is death. "

Well, as /u/lifthrasiir [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/34cyas/rustfmt_help_wanted/cqtmqpk), Rust is still an evolving language and the conventions aren't set in stone. Any formatting tool needs to reflect conventions, not define them. Go got away with it because the conventions were set by the Go authors, and then enforced by gofmt. But while the Rust project is attempting to set various conventions, there's still a lot that hasn't been determined yet.

cqughnu&applehelp&Swoop666&"If you want a cheaper way to try to troubleshoot it. 

Remove one RAM module and see if you can replicate the error (if easily replicated). Then swap the RAM with the one you removed and try again. 

Then try in the empty slot with each module. 

If it continues to give you the error with both individual RAM modules in different slots, chances are it's the logic board. If it only does it with one of the RAM modules and it doesn't matter what slot it's in, it's that module. If it does it with both RAM modules but only in one slot, it's most likely the MLB."

cqugho3&Clojure&Arkolix&"Laziness is great. Building up seqs recursively with `lazy-seq` can be super elegant - I recently wrote code to fetch a lazy sequence of items from a list key in [Redis](http://redis.io), transparently fetching in batches, for when the size of the whole list may exceed memory on the client which is pretty nifty. Clojure's lazy seq stuff made the code pretty clean and a breeze to write.

However, I wish I spent more time really studying it and deeply understanding things like head retention and memoization earlier when I was getting started, which I've been bitten by many times (many of our datasets are larger than available memory). If you incorrectly handle a large lazy seq, things will explode and youll run out of memory.

The vast majority of Clojure's core functions return lazy seqs (when applicable); it's usually called out on [clojuredocs.org](http://clojuredocs.org) (e.g., see [map](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/map)), and I've spent a surprising amount of time digging through [clojure's core.clj](https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/clj/clojure/core.clj) to verify details for myself.

I've only been bitten once or twice by things not evaluating when I expected them to, eg.

    (let [foo (range 10)]
      (map fn-with-side-effects foo) ; Won't run! Need `doall` or `doseq`
      :baz)

Again, head retention is super important to watch out for. A naive example:

    (def huge-coll (range 1e10))
    (println (count huge-coll))
    ; Uh oh! huge-coll is lazy, but since we used `def` its head is
    ; retained and taking up tons of memory"

cqughop&askgaybros&tescocola&"There was a BBC documentary - possibly [When Tommy met Mo](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03ghfyp) I can't quite remember - which followed EDF leader Tommy Robinson meeting prominent British Muslims. If I remember it correctly they attended a kind of town-hall style meeting for people who were worried about Muslims in Britain. What surprised me was a young gay man stood up and said he supported UKIP as Muslims disliked gay people, and he thought their position on immigration would limit homophobia from the Muslim community.

This scene definitely happened - I'm just unsure if it's from the exact programme I mentioned above. But whichever programme it came from, I was shocked by this attitude on so many levels.  But maybe it can shed some light on why your mother intends to vote UKIP - a misunderstanding of the country's original problems and an incorrect understanding of what the party stands for and would achieve."

I'd always offer to blow him to help him finish if it hurt too much to continue with PIV. When he's having trouble cumming, anything where he can be passive and not exert himself seems to do the trick, so that's either me blowing him or riding him.

Why would you hire a black American? Give one a mortgage? Let that person in your school? Date your daughter? Trust them on a routine traffic stop? Believe that they need that government help? Give a black person a promotion?

You wouldn't. It would be dumb too, if what you believe is true. It is the fucking logical outcome. So, how do they get ahead?

cqught4&FeMRADebates&dejour&"The paper might be bad, but they should have said nothing about gender.  They could have said that the paper was methodologically weak and ideologically biased.

Since the paper was about gender differences in the PhD to postdoc transition, the reviewer probably could have said that getting some input from men would be valuable.  Just as a paper about gender differences authored only by men might benefit from the reverse advice.

The speculation about stamina and work hours was inappropriate and barely related to the peer review.

EDIT: I'm now putting it together that the paper was about gender differences in the PhD to postdoc transition.  So I suppose the snippets might be relevant to the submitted study, and not just a commentary on the gender of the authors.  If the study concluded that there was sexism in academia, it makes sense that alternative explanations should have been investigated.  So I'm going to say it sounds bad, but perhaps not as bad in context.  I'll reserve judgement."

cqughv7&DaystromInstitute&altrocks&"The area around the wormhole opening was considered a navigation hazard, basically. All of the spatial weirdness and exotic radiation produced by the wormhole opening would cause most ships to avoid the area. Remember, on the first trip through the wormhole it was pretty rough and certain modifications had to be made, even with late 24th century technology, so that ships could safely pass through on a regular basis.

It's similar to the tachyon eddies found by Sisko during his historical recreation of ancient Bajoran spaceflight. They could detect such things no problem, but how they interpreted it and reacted to it would be very different."

cqughvj&Physics&Saganomics&It's not all that surprising in retrospect. The fire suppression system in the building was designed for suppressing a typical office fire until the fire department can get there. Having part of a skyscraper fall on it, a water main break on Vesey St limiting the water flow to the building, and having the fire department decide not to fight the fire due to the extensive damage already caused by the WTC collapse was never part of the original design. Expecting the sprinkler system to control that would be like expecting a person with a watering can to control a bonfire.

Which reminds me of a fun fact I heard through the grapevine; some of the writers and other people who worked on the show had never seen or tried anything from Wegmans or the Utz snack company until they went to Scranton to scout it out for the show. Supposedly they ended up going to Wegmans and trying some of their products and Utz products and loved them so much that they snuck the brands into various shots around the office. There's quite a few times you can see these two companies' products, especially in the break-room.

cqughwj&leagueoflegends&AzzyIzzy&"IEM was a huge tournament, but the setup for showing who would make it to quarters, semis, and finals was terrible. There is too much chance that flukes, minor tilt, or cheese strategies confounded the overall results. Which is to say, TSM didn't necessarily win based off of luck or cheese, but WE might have won off luck or tilt(although spirit was impressive as hell), given there was only 1 series that featured a total of 5 possible games. 

Thoorin did a great summary on the whole situation on his youtube channel. Because he was willing to say TSM did show great skill (probably the best in the west), but globally it didn't set them up to be a top 3 team in the world based on such a small sample and inferior rule set for how the matches went.

I just see the whole ""OMG you're triggering me"" satire posts so so so often, while I see the attempt to censor pretty much no where. I agree that there are a lot of children on tumblr that complain about a lot of stupid things. But a bunch of children and ""a few news articles"" about college kids who think they have everything all figured out (like a lot of people in college think) hardly warrant how much reddit likes to make fun of them. 

Regarding your point about PTSD and psychology, I also agree that never confronting your traumatic situation is probably bad. However, I don't believe that many psychologists would agree that trigger warnings are a bad thing. Again, just because someone is choosing not to think about a traumatic experience in a given moment, it doesn't mean they're trying to block it out forever."

As such, it does draw attention to a real tendency in movies. however, the implication that this is misogyny is a bit of a leap.

There are many factors at play. Gender roles absolutely result in some of those factors. however it's not simply anti-woman. It's restrictive assumptions and expectations placed on both men and women.

I ranted about this at great length here: http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/2uu7pp/genre_responsibility_empathy_value_and_women_in/

Then there's also the fact that, in movies intended for male audiences, the focus is most often on male characters.

Movies with many important female characters are generally intended for female audiences and these are generally romances, so obviously most conversations will be about the (male) love interest."

cqugi0y&asianamerican&arjun10&"I should clarify my point.  I agree with you when you say that ethnic tribalism is something to consider.  But you seem to have been arguing that ethnic tribalism is good and *should* be the only thing to consider.  I am not just arguing that class is a factor, but that class should be *the* most important factor in solidarity and pan-ethnic struggle.  

For example, it doesn't make any sense at all for low-wage South Asian workers to ally themselves with the South-Asian-lead business councils and lobbyist groups--their interests are entirely opposite.  It does make sense, however, for them to ally with Latino immigrants, for example.  

Likewise, back in the '60s, it *should* have made sense for White and Black workers in midwestern industrial cities to ally with one another--but too many White workers were held back because of their racial tribalism and White supremacist attitudes, and everybody was weakened because of it.  On other other, during this same time period, many Black and White people in the ghettos of Chicago successfully organized alongside one another to address issues of poverty and police violence, and forged an incredibly powerful alliance.

All in all, I would argue that economic dynamics are hugely influential in impacting how social and political dynamics play out.  As such, organizing with class in mind can and should be a way to cut across racial lines and fight for a better world."

cqugi30&eagles&Tentapuss&"Poorly phrased on my part, and I understand why I confused you.  My point was that the Phillies are hobbled by the gambles that they took giving big contracts to guys like Howard, Utley, and Lee, who are all making a ton of money and barely playing quad A level ball (if playing at all), but who can't be moved.  As a result of the choices the front office made to keep those few players with the organization, it's going to be a long road to rebuild back to a competitive level.  While it's a different scenario, it comes down to the same principle - it's very to risk all of your resources - whether those resources are financial or player skill - just to make sure you land one or two guys, particularly when you're then left with insufficient resources to let you surround those guys with sufficient complimentarily skilled players to make the whole thing succeed.

Shitty phrasing on my part.  The simpler and more direct way would have been to just point to the Skins debacle with RGIII, though they were a dumpster fire on both sides of that transaction, except for one good year."

cqugi4q&IAmA&LuisXGonzalez&"Another perspective here: it sounds like you're into filmmaking already. My friends are as well (I'm also a writer). Here's my advice.

Move to Los Angeles. Volunteer for indie projects. Network. Give up gaming for reading screenplays. Collaborate. Produce something. Keep producing.

The friends I have that are in guilds spend nearly every waking hour living and breathing movies, and they don't make much money at all. They do have hobbies (such as comics), but they fall by the wayside. Their hobbies seem to become watching movies. Making movies has become their hobby. If you can't give up gaming, then you're probably not that serious about it. Remember, you can always come back to your hobbies if things don't work out.

Like you said, Breaking Bad was rejected by several networks, and Vince was an established writer. There really aren't that many screen writers in Hollywood, so it's a tough proposition. Vince gave the best advice I can think of; you need persistence, but you also need talent and luck. Hone your craft, write a large stack of screenplays, and then decide if its for you.

cqugi51&politicaleconomics&adakel&"This is the wrong question for several reasons.

First, its not at all clear that good things (economic growth, poverty reduction, real wage increases, whatever) will happen if people and businesses get more economic freedom.  Free markets, especially in labor, healthcare, and finance, can fail often and spectacularly.  This isn't to say that free markets never work, only that in some markets and in some conditions, they don't.

Second, liberty is a really ambiguous idea.  Does my right to vote matter if there are no roads to get to polling stations?  Is my right to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" meaningful if I'm unemployed and can only afford to live in a crime-ridden neighborhood?

Third, the Heritage foundation is basically just a propaganda machine."

cqugi59&TwoXChromosomes&JohnnyReeko&"Is it that big a deal that it was suggested they bring on the opposite gender to help remove bias from a study on gender differences? I mean it makes sense to me.

It's not like they were doing a paper on the migration patterns of exotic birds or anything, it was specifically related to gender and therefore there is a strong likelihood that the results could contain bias if only one of the genders is actually doing the study. Getting a male author could eliminate that problem.

I do find it kind of ironic that the women were told they were biased and so they instantly complained they were victims of sexism. To me that is just a clear indication that they were indeed biased, like they were looking for it (called confirmation bias). It's a research study! They should be scientists first and women second, science is about being objective and looking at facts not about what you want to be the case."

cqugi7s&FeMRADebates&AnarchCassius&"I can't speak for the MRM but imo it's less invalid and more overblown. It reminds me of the pro-censorship activists who attacked the Power Rangers show based on count of ""number of violent acts"" per second rather than any kind of overall context or comparison to other media.

The creator says it was a joke. The character who said actually endorsed it as a hard rule despite insistence that's not what it's about. So why make take an off-hand comic character's remark in a context they weren't even expressing as great political commentary?

The question is really what's the feminist argument *for* the Bechdel Test? Does it really illustrate anything useful about an individual movie or movies in general?

Numerous tests can be devised, the Mako Mori test, the is violence by women against men played for laughs test, but they all oversimplify. It's the entire of idea of using such reductionist logic to analyze anything that I object to. It's one small detail, elevating it to the level of a Named Test gives it an artificial significance that detracts from the big picture."

cqugi8b&leagueoflegends&JDC31&"It was no secret him and xpecial didnt get along. They were colleagues and not friends. Also him and OddOne just never really interracted alone. Regi was Chaox's close friend and Dyrus was his best friend, but Chaox and Regi kept getting in disputes which put strain on them from time to time, as well as Chaox underperforming and steadily getting worse. Regi did what they had to do, and a mixture of the strain on their relationship, chaox being hurt from regi benching him, neither one of them wanting to particularly come forward to the other and how close they once were just made for one of those situations that people tend to stop talking all together.

There is probably no 'bad blood' now. They more than likley dont talk now through having very little to talk about as well as no reason to start talking again. Chaox was hurt, Regi was also hurt, both just pushed passed it the way they deal with things and I guess never looked back.

Its a shame because if Chaox didnt take a break after getting benched hed have gotten on another team no bother (because Xpecial made him look amazing, and any team woulda picked him up) and hed have gotten more of a chance to work on his performance. Instead he took the break, and lost all chance for competative experience, and decided tocome back to the competative scene after so long, fell behind on meta shifts, and became 'rusty' so to speak, and now ks pretty much doomed to challanger series of whatever region he is in. In the event he qualifies. The TDK situation will happen to him. Every region has much better ADC's now and hes past his prime. Hes a really nice dude though (met him at LCS london).

cqugi99&depression&joef_3&"As someone a bit older, I can say this with some authority - pretty much everyone is attractive to some chunk of people.  One thing that happens in school is that people are afraid to appear different, so if they have tastes that lie outside the mainstream, they may very well be afraid to express them. I knew a couple guys who were into bigger girls, but were way too insecure to express it in high school. Not everyone - I'm not even sure most people - find the sort of default media-created concept of what is attractive to actually be attractive.  

It sucks that you're on the wrong end of that sort of thing right now, but it will change with time.  And hell, if you're still in school, your body hasn't even finished developing.  You might look far more like how you want to look in a few years."

The entire point is that the richest countries help out. If we were a net recipient of EU funding we wouldn't be having a conservation about whether the EU is right for us because we'd want to be in it so we could move to Germany.

But because countries are only wealthy in general and often include areas of much larger deprivation sometimes net contributors benefit from those kinds of programmes. It's embarrassing really that there are even areas so deprived in Britain that the EU has even needed to designate some of them as convergence zones.

cqugibi&explainlikeimfive&jaa101&"GIF is a ""normal"" image format like many others including JPG, TIFF and PNG.  GIF was probably the most common format on the early web.  It works best where there are large areas of the same colour and its limit of 256 colours tends not to be an issue for maps.  It's a lossless format so all those hard edges common in maps reproduce correctly whereas JPG, designed more for real-world images, tends to leave artifacts.  GIF is also very old and simple so browser support is assured.

PNG was the successor format to GIF, pushed by issues around patents that have since expired.  It has better compression and other advantages but I suspect Google went with GIF for its maps early on when browser support for PNG was not quite good enough.

For all those webmasters out there hosting sites displaying logos and similar artwork with only a few solid colours as JPG files, that's probably the wrong thing to do; PNG or GIF is a better choice.  Leave JPG for photographic images.  Even at quite high quality settings (and large file sizes) JPG can mess up the clean edges common in logos."

I'm a 20 year old guy who learned English by himself and knows some Python, PHP, SQL, C#, D, HTML, CSS, JS, etc. from side projects.

Too bad I got the morning classes and enrolled in the mid of the year. I'm in a classroom with only another 2 much older students, both of which have a hard time with logic and probably won't ever make anything past a $500 static websites with some PHP.

 * 50g of Fat

 * 35g of Protein

 * 9.5g of Carbs

**Servings:**

 * 2 people

**Prep Time:**

 * 15 minutes

**Cook Time:**

 * 1 hour

**Ingredients:**

 * 1 spaghetti squash

 * 4 sausage links

 * 2 tbsp coconut oil

 * 1/2 red bell pepper

 * 1/2 green bell pepper

 * 1 egg

 * 2 oz white cheddar cheese

 * 2 tbsp parmesan

 * 1 tsp basil

 * 1 tsp crushed red pepper

 * 1/2 tsp garlic powder

 * 1 tsp salt

 * 1/2 tsp pepper

 * 1 tbsp fresh parsley

**Instructions:**

 * First, we’re going to prepare our spaghetti squash. Preheat the oven to 375°F.

 * Wash and slice (this is a laborious process) the squash horizontally into 1 inch rings. Lay them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and sprinkle with olive oil, salt and pepper.

 * Bake in the oven for about 40 minutes.

 * While it’s baking, let’s prepare the add ins. Cook your sausage links in a pan oiled with coconut oil on a medium-high heat until they’re brown on all sides (about 10 minutes). Whether or not they’re fully cooked, take the off the heat and let them rest for a minute.

 * While they’re resting, add some chopped peppers onto the pan to become tender.

 * While the peppers are cooking, slice your sausages into about ½ inch pieces and then add them to cook and marinade with the peppers.

 * At this point, add all the spices you’d like! We added salt, pepper, garlic powder, crushed red pepper, and basil.

 * When the bake time for the squash is up, you should notice the tops of each squash ring are darker and more saturated looking. This means the strands are loose enough to “spaghettify”.

 * Using a fork, tug away at the insides of the squash from it’s flesh. You should end of with little mounds of what looks just like spaghetti!

 * Throw in all the spaghetti squash to the pan and toss to combine. Let all the flavors incorporate.

 * Add in chunks of about 2 oz of white cheddar cheese. Stir to help melt them. Lower the heat to medium-low and let simmer covered for a few minutes.

 * Lastly, turn the heat off and crack an egg into the mix. Make sure to keep stirring and tossing the mix to not let much of the egg cook all at once. Stirring often will ensure the mix is creamy and fully covered instead of a large piece of fried egg in a corner.

 * Spoon a heaping helping into a plate and garnish with fresh, chopped parsley and Parmesan cheese. Enjoy your Low-Carbonara!

I understand a lot of what you're saying. There is some bad advice on this subreddit that could be easily solved by going to the sidebar or directly to this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/igh87/concerned_but_dont_know_what_to_say_here_are_some/ .

A lot of the people coming here are well intentioned but reddit tends to favor those with loud voices and angry messages so those often rub off onto others. 

While I can't really point you in a good direction for the defaults, you can find some very kind and supportive subreddits deep down in this website. One of my personal favorites at the moment is /r/TheChurchOfRogers which is based on kindness to others as if they were our neighbors (based on the show Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. Maybe browsing there can give you these better and safer feelings.

Reddit is unfortunately a site taken over by the opinions of about 4000 people. If you ever look at the controversial tab of a subreddit or even scrolling far enough down, you'll find those hidden treasures of good comments. I hope you will find those same kinds of good comments under this post as well.

cqugidp&podemos&raromerol&Lo que le causó insatisfacción fue descubrir que Fraga se aprovechaba de él, como lo hizo con Ferrer Salat, Hernández Mancha, etc.. Lo exhibía como un jovencito prodigio futuro heredero, pero seguía controlándolo todo, sin dejar nada del mando, ni permitir ninguna herencia, algo así como hace Isabel IIª de Granbretaña e Irlanda del Norte (el Reino Unido) con su hijo Carlitos el orejón. Así que comenzó a enfrentarse a él y éste lo defenestró. El único que entendió a Fraga fue Asnar, que lo envió al exilio gallego a que jugase al dominó con los viejos como Presidente de la Junta(plata) de Galicia. No has indicado el otro punto crucial en su vida: su divorcio, algo que le hizo entrar en contradicción completamente con su línea de pensamiento anterior. Y el PSOE también lo ha ninguneado: lo utilizó para atraer votantes defraudados PePerro-PoPulistas pero no le dio ningún puesto de prestigio, y menos aún cuando los ha superado por la izquierda. Por cierto: Monedero también lleva gafas estilo Himmler.

cqugidy&AskReddit&Fauxreguard&When I was a kid I always used to have this dream where something was trying to find me by looking in through the windows in the middle of the night. Sometimes it was aliens, and sometimes it was giants, and sometimes it was both. I'd be in my room and there'd be some presence outside trying to see in. The aliens would split up and go to all the windows, so I'd have to hide, but there wouldn't be any perfect hiding place and after a while they'd come into the house, so I'd have to keep moving from house to house and keep trying to get away. The giants would look in through the second-story windows and sometimes they'd tear the roofs off of the houses. I have blockout curtains on all of my windows these days.

I'm a giver, sometimes to a fault. I don't do things for karma or exposure or what have you, but I'm just naturally super sensitive so I can't just sit around, especially when someone is down or needs a hand. It's one of those ""well wouldn't anyone do it because we are all human and that's what humans do?"" things, but apparently not. It sounds like you might be similar.

It's hard to remember that, yes, some people are horrifically self-centered, but the reality is that most people are good but they just don't pick up on the little things, especially if they're not a giver by nature.

Where they does leave you is potentially having to suspend your art from the ceiling (or the moulding if there is moulding) by putting some eye hooks above the wall. I don't know how much art you have to hang but it takes a loooooooong time to hang art that way.

What are the walls like? How high are they? Can you install a wooden cleat across the top of the wall and hang from clips [like this](http://www.finearttips.com/2012/06/diy-build-an-art-gallery-hanging-system-for-around-100/)?"

Karpeles was convicted of fraud in France and sentenced to a medium stretch in prison.  He was convicted in absentia and has not returned to France since the conviction (and, hence, has not served his sentence).

How in the world is there any question that Karpeles was (at the very most generous) engaging in extra-legal behavior running MtGox?  Whether he intended harm isn't the question, as the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  Leopards do not change their spots, especially when said leopard has been assessed by various peers as borderline autistic.

What matters is the outcome: a convicted felon magically made a lot of money (Bitcoin and otherwise) disappear ... and not only is still walking around free, but has been white-knighted regarding aspects of his behavior during the US SR investigation.

cqugift&AskReddit&RaPlD&"There are certain traits that are generally accepted as characteristic for the less intelligent. Like troubles with memory  and retention of non trivial facts, issues solving logical problems and math in general, sense of orientation, or just plainly doing things that are stupid on a daily basis. Like always looking for your keys when they are in your pocket, or not being able to memorize the layout of the town you live in or the building you work in, stuff like that. There are plenty of things that can make you feel stupid, and if they constantly come up, chances are you are not the brightest.

So you are spending $100 if you are using a bunch of piddly paid mods not worth their salt. Where as before it was free and you could experiment. I know I wouldn't use any of the mods I currently use if they were paid. Hell I wouldn't have gotten skyrim and I wouldn't get any Bethesda games in general if mods had a pay wall. 

Bethesda make big worlds but they are always so flat and you have to shove so many mods into them and unless you experience that, which TB hasn't, you just don't understand the largest issue with paid mods.

cqugiiq&nfl&youredoneson&"I see where you're coming from. 

Yours is definitely one style of leadership and a style that works every day. Les's style at LSU is obviously a different one. 

Just analyzing Les's style, it clearly works with many guys, as several players LSU puts on these lists completely turn their college careers around, some even becoming captains. With others, it never worked (as noted by some Texans fans in here who drafted two of them). No strategy works with 100% of people 100% of the time. 

At the end of the day, players continue committing to LSU and they send more underclassmen to the league than anybody, so whatever they are doing, for the most part, it seems to be working. 

Edit: On a side note, this world needs more people doing the work you are doing. Just wanted to say ""Thank you."" "

cqugil3&news&therealdannyking&"Well, usually something becomes inedible because of spoilage toxins (like bacteria, fungi, or viruses and their waste-products).  When an edible item is frozen [EDIT: and sealed off from oxygen], metabolism for most things living on and in it stops - and spoilage ceases.

We have a few anecdotal instances of [woolly mammoth meat,](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2725/prehistoric-its-whats-for-dinner) that was frozen in tundra being eaten, but I can't vouch for their veracity.

I've not done any research on bacteria and viruses that can survive a hard, cold vacuum - but those would be the culprits in making something inedible after billions of years.  Well, that and the fact that we would almost certainly have either evolved beyond the need for a stomach or gone extinct."

Enemy troop movement in the caves suggest a eminent attack. Platoons poor out of the warpgate and move straight for your Interlink.You rally troops to intercept the enemy and prepare to defend the base .You bring even pop to the fight and since you're defending you have the upper hand. Wave after wave of enemy forces smash off your troops making no progress .While defending the base you notice your NTU/ resources levels are low. Enemy infiltrators have installed a virus and destroyed all the turrets causing NTU levels to drop fast. The enemy couldn't break threw the defense so they decided to starve us of resource so the base would lose power and to go neutral giving the attackers a much needed advantage.After you notice the NTU drain you send 2 squads back to the warpgate with air and armor defense for a ant run.2 mins left before the NTU runs out and the loadstars are in the air with the ants in back.The armor and air left the warp gate mins before ,and are clearing out the enemy armor and air in and around the NTU silo. As the loadstars fly over the base  you make the call for friendly  emp's to go off to clear the way for the ants,and with seconds left the NTU silo is refiling and the base is safe, or so you thought. While you were planning your NTU run the enemy planned a max crash and sent 4 infiltrators into your basement to setup routers, and now  the enemy is 50 strong in your gen with 25 maxes standing next to your blown up generator ."

Honestly... SJWs bear so much resemblance to 19th century Victorians and 16th century puritans... and all the other nut jobs before them... it's absolute whaling insanity.

A few years ago I was an optimistic futurist. Surrounded with MOOCs, and new technologies, 3d printing and all that, I was convinced that we were casually heading towards a blissful utopian society were knowledge and facts are held above all, and that the uncensored internet was the perfect forum for the truth and debate to prevail unfettered.

Microsoft has taken the stance of our consumer base is first class citizens so a game SHOULD be released on our platform the same day as any other.  If you can't meet that then you should offer something extra for making them wait.

Developers can take it or leave it but Microsoft has shown they are willing to let it slide.  Let's remember for a moment Microsoft is a massive corporation run but corporate trained people.  Indie devs might not be the best business people to deal with.  Sure they might make a great game but their business acumen and attitude might be total garbage, we really don't know."

cqugio6&Cynicalbrit&Cathsaigh&"I don't contribute that much to the mods I use. I comment on the thread on the features I like, and report game breaking bugs I haven't seen reported before. I certainly don't think I'm in any way entitled to have mods for free, and appreciate the work modders put in to their mods for no tangible benefit.

The reason I was worried about this was because there's a long history of sharing assets for free, and profit being made on mods could put an end to that. If I bought the COK mod for Warband would Floris get a cut, as COK was built on Floris? Would the guys who made Brytenwalda get a say in the monetization on all the mods that built on them?

What about IP seperate from the modded game? Non-profit stuff generally get a free pass, but could the Game of Thrones mod for Crusader Kings have been made if the modding scene was monetized?"

The ones that are trying to move out generally have a job and some sort of fiscal responsibility.

Then you have the other type. They may or may not contribute anything at home. They likely bitch all the time about being stuck at home, but have no plan to ever actually leave.

cqugiq8&NoFap&SiriusCyberneticCorp&"At twelve I was watching whatever I could get my grubby paws on, but it was all mainstream. It didn't have to be extreme for me to realise that I was consuming imagery that was intentionally produced in a certain way, defined by peculiar traits and portraying sex as something polished, brutish and alien which I couldn't relate to in any meaningful sense. Amateur videos were much more interesting to me but curiously less arousing at that age, because I hadn't yet made the full connection between emotion and sex. My arousal depended entirely upon the visual, and I had no past experience to draw feelings from when I masturbated. So I knew from the beginning that my association with sex through porn was abstract and divorced from reality. What i really wanted was amateur porn of genuine teenagers my age having sensual, awkward sex of the kind I imagined, which of course didn't exist. I craved educational porn, I suppose, but what was available most easily was porn involving leggy blonde women of indeterminate age getting fucked mercilessly by brutish men who even then I felt disgusted looking at, performing the same litany of acts and positions over and over again. I remember thinking many times ""is this it?"" and ""where's the loving and the cuddling?"" It's interesting that I managed to distance myself from it as much as I did, considering how much I was watching. I was always thinking to myself ""could I ever do that to a girl?"" ""Is that really what I will be expected to do?"" ""How can that possibly be enjoyable?"" etc, questions like that. It turned me off, and yet I doubted my own feelings because this stuff seemed like it was everywhere. ""Surely, it must be me that's weird for not liking the idea of anal sex"" and stuff like this.

One side affect of porn that's affected me is the third person perspective. When you're having sex, you can't see the same angles that you can see in porn, and it made me realise how much I had begun to rely on those angles and those movements that porn focuses on. Together with the death grip problem, and finding that I was trying to replicate the feeling of masturbation through PIV, it made it difficult to come and I think that's when I first started to understand the negative effects of watching years of pornography from beginning of my sexually active life.

Good luck, you may fail numerous times but each time you get back up and start again you will be a little bit more determined. The thing to remember is, you are armed against it now. You understand the effects and that is a shield in itself."

This results in zero-tolerance policies to scare people into letting the students do whatever they want without teachers being able to interfere.  Firing a good teacher is cheaper than paying higher insurance rates.

Microsoft had to do that to try and get these apps on their platform because that's a big reason people stay away from the platform. 

The idea is that once these apps are on the platform and the companies behind them see the numbers they will eventually move to UAP to get additional features (and to get to the Xbox/HoloLens as well)"

But if you've literally convinced yourself and lied to others that you are the opposite gender, you're mentally ill. Please don't recognize yourself as a female, but a M2F transgender or vice versa.

EDIT: for illustration, imagine i went into a female bathroom and was held up by girls asking what i was doing there. i exclaim 'no no, it's cool! i'm a girl!' should i be denied access to the bathroom because i haven't made any effort to look like a girl? why does it matter what i look like? if i 'believe' i'm a girl i should be able to pee from my penis in here!"

The irony is that her behavior just might.

As well as therapy to address this behavior, what are her plans for building a life in your new home?

Edited to add: I had wanted to say also, that I personally would have told my husband if I found out a friend used to have a crush on me.  And I would expect the same from him.

The unit I chose has a better manufacturer and better components. As for processor, the Xeon has 4 more threads then the i5, which makes it ideal for content creation.

Overall, the Pats are tied for third in getting the most talent (by Total CareerAV) out of our drafts, despite being the most successful franchise in the league in this period.  This is a combination of BB being able to accumulate picks (via lopsided trades) and being above average (9th out of 32) at getting CareerAV for our pick value.  

The only reason this graph makes us look bad is small sample size including our two worst drafts (2007, 2008)."

cqugj15&wow&nutellacoma&"A few things;

* Gear doesn't matter at your current level, it matters at a 100
* Switching to Arms or Fury might be a better idea once you reach a 100 or are finding it hard to tank without people getting up your butt about mistakes. Being a damage dealer in a group setting is a lot less pressure because you aren't expected to know much of anything
* Join a social guild that has a raid team and see if they will let you learn the ropes. At end game there are a number of different types of guilds; strictly social ones that don't raid, social ones that have raid teams, casual raiding guilds that raid norm/heroic, semi hardcore guilds that raid heroic and dabble in mythic and progression guilds that are focused on clearing mythic. My advice is to try and get into a social or casual raiding guild as they explore more elements of the game and are often friendlier. 
* Each dungeon and raid boss has a loot table with various drops that will vary from kill to kill. In dungeons and looking for raid, all loot is personal. In raids at the norm/heroic/mythic level there is an option to have that loot on master looter or personal, with most choosing the first option.
* Once you hit a 100 there are a few ways to gear; you can randomly queue for pvp battlegrounds which will award you honor which you can the spend at a vendor to buy 620 ilvl gear. You can queue for normal dungeons at level 100 when your ilvl is below 610, once it is above that, you can queue for heroic dungeons which drop 630 gear. I think that the best path for you would be to enter some random pvp battlegrounds for that honor gear I mentioned, until your ilvl is above 610. From there, queue up for heroic dungeons to farm 630 gear. Above that, there is the Looking For Raid option which allows you experience the Highmaul and Blackrock Foundry raids and they drop epic gear.

Out of the all of the above, the finding the right guild is probably going to be the most challenging. I suggest joining a social guild at the moment, and once youre at a 100 and at a decent ilvl 650 +, looking at finding a guild on your server that is raiding at a casual level. The best way to do this is to look on the guild recruitment forums or realm forum on the blizz website.

Good luck! Hit me up with your battletag if you want to have some help in game.  "
cqugj16&Colorado&grundyhippie&"I'm sure you're a ""less regulation"" type so why does it matter? There are tons of affluent, private equity, what-have-you firms who hope for their Madoff moment. They buy up functioning companies, borrow off the equity, then fire all the workers and liquidate. There is no moral standing for that manner of destructive profit.

I believe in community, in ""United we stand."" You want a functioning society to run on the whims of a few.

We will always disagree. Your ""charity"" means nada. We can all brag about what we've done to play catch up. It's time to play ""let's figure out why so many people need catching up.""

You don't have a ""right"" to smooth highways, inspected beef or filtered water, but I bet you're glad the people before you in society decided those were worthwhile places to put public funds.

Your type complain about what doesn't work, but you never see what does work. And every solution is ""private profit, public bailout"" and we're all fucking sick of it."

cqugj2a&BabyBumps&cakeilikecake&"I'm sorry you are feeling this way, its a really tough adjustment! Big hug to you! Can someone come and hold the baby so you can take a nap, take a long shower, or go get a haircut? Getting my haircut when baby was 5 weeks old was magic! A friend had thoughtfully given me a gift card for my shower, lovely lady that she is! Just sitting in the chair and not doing anything, just letting someone take care of me for half an hour was incredibly relaxing. And then I was actually happy to get home to baby, because I had had a break.  Just something that makes you feel more like yourself and not simply your new title of ""mom""?   
Or do you feel like you are experiencing depression? If so please talk to your doctor. Either way, you are not alone. It is so overwhelming to go home to a completely new reality, and be responsible for someone you love so much, but that is simultaneously exhausting!"

I remember when I used to think they were the ""hottest.""  That's when I believed there was such a thing as ""most attractive.""  There isn't.  Everyone has flaws.  There is what you're attracted to, and what you're turned off by.  The reason I was even attracted to them in the first place was because of their presence in the mass media.  There were always hot blonde bimbos running around on TV being featured as ""the best,"" or hottest.


The more you narrow your attraction criteria in an arbitrary, irrational manner, the less opportunities you have.

Actually receiving interest from 7-8 brunette hipster chicks is doing better than 95% of the male population.

Also, as you pointed out: ""party"" chicks are so dumb that any decent human being would want to ship them to a desert island after spending 5 minutes with them."

cqugj32&AskReddit&alluran&"Don't blame Telstra - Ziggy stated 15 years ago that Telstra's copper was ""5 minutes to midnight"" (his words). That's why they started rolling out HFC, which got canned when the NBN deals were brokered.

Now the NBN has been scrapped, and we're left with a network that Telstra has been doing minimal maintenance on for the last 15 years, due to a planned obsolescence.

Abbott has then gone ahead and balanced Australia's future on this dying network. Oh, and did I mention they sued TPG for rolling out it's own fibre once they canned FTTH NBN? In the end, it's the government that's fucked the network, not Telstra.

I WAS paying $230/mth for 10/10mbps business grade connection to my home in the Sydney CBD, 300m from the nearest exchange.

And we don't expect you to know our states. I know Europeans hate hearing this but since most of your countries are smaller than our states, we generally don't view them as very important (Especially since many states have larger populations and economies than many European Nations).

cqugj6t&HyruleWarriors&jfreak1024&"Amiibos are basically action figures of Nintendo characters originally intended for Smash Bros, where you could tap the figure's base onto the GamePad and play against/train an AI player and then save it onto a small chip in the base by tapping it onto the GamePad again. 

In HW, you can tap TLoZ amiibos (Link, Zelda, Shiek, Ganondorf) at the title menu once a day to receive weapons for that character. In some cases, they can drop upgraded weapons (I got a Triforce Spinner from my Zelda Amiibo the first time I used it, but since then it's been lots of rapiers). Non-Zelda themes amiibos drop other random things, ranging from 1-50k Rupees or various materials. 

Amiibos can be found at your local game retailer for ~$13 each. "

Just the _idea_ of working with this much sheer data (3393019 comments at last count) is just mind-boggling. As late as fifty years ago it was unthinkable. And yet here it is, sitting on my hard drive while a number of scripts whir around it, working their magic.

cqugj7h&TwoXChromosomes&conceptionary&Yes, because everyone can just have those things.. its just that simple! I don't know why you just think that the girl HAS to be at blame somehow.. and you mentioned a situation that she was 'helpless' because no one was around so she is dumb. Honestly, even if people were around, most of the time people don't want to get involved and would be likely to ignore that something was even happening. You are getting at me as if I am acting like its a simple black and white situation - but honestly you are.. you're saying that if someone doesn't have someone around them and something happens to them - they are dumb. But it is just simply illogical to have someone with you at all times. The only person who should be held accountable at all is the person(s) who committed the rape.

A Ferrari has always represented something more than just specifications and top speeds. When you are in a Ferrari it isn't about pushing physics to the limit or to claim the top track time. What I think its about, is the persona, the character that a Ferrari bestows on the driver. When you are driving in one, it doesn't matter if you're going 5mph down main street or 201 around the track... because you know that you are in a marvel of human genius and luxury. As long as you're in the driver's seat, you are elevated to something beyond what any one person can achieve alone. /fauxphilosophy

cqugjcf&ClickerHeroes&Nosfrat&"Let's say your run lasts an entire day, DR will take you about 30 zones further at best. It's a decent little bonus but definitely not something you should rely on. When it's available go ahead and hit 8-6-9, but I wouldn't go 15 minutes without using any skills just for an extra 10% DPS (that'll take you less than one zone further - health increases by 15% every zone).

The strategy for a deep run depends a lot on whether you're gonna use an autoclicker or not. Either way, I never saw two people saying the same things about skills, I think everyone has their own way of managing skills depending on many factors.

I don't even know how *I* manage skills, I just ""feel"" it. Looking at the screen, my current DPS, cooldowns, etc., I just (kinda) know what to use, but I'm totally unable to explain it."

My $.02 
My wife (who was my girlfriend at the time) explicitly asked me NOT to get her a diamond ring, after watching some special on diamonds. (Side note, diamond engagement ring is NOT a tradition, it's a result of a very successful marketing campaign by DeBeers, who essentially owns a monopoly on diamond production/distribution around the world. Diamonds have no innate value, they are not a rare stone at all, the supply is just artificially restricted. If diamond market was ""free"", the value of diamond is estimated to be about $5/karat).
Maybe let her watch a documentary on diamond, and present her with a spectacular sapphire ring. A much more beautiful rare stone can be had for $2-3k. 
My wife constantly gets complements on her sapphire btw."

It's quite similar to the standard yale profile, so considering I'm so used to that keyway it would explain why I didn't have an issue with this one. You should try and get your hands on some yales to practice on, they're a ton of fun. The most common profile is the 1A (called the Y1 in the US). It's intimidating at first but you actually get used to it very quickly if you pick them enough. :D

cqugje0&explainlikeimfive&aintnufincleverhere&"I believe the answer is yes. I am not an economist and this is an amateur opinion.

 Here's how I came to that conclusion:

Lets talk about rent. Lets say that we think people aren't living in good conditions, too many people have to live in crappy homes and we want to help them afford better homes. So we just hand out cash. To everybody. What happens? Are there suddenly more homes for people to move into?

No. The number of homes is the same. And the landlords, they realize that everybody has more money, so they can raise their rent. So rent goes up. Now we're back in the same situation we were in before. People still can't afford rent, and giving them money wont help because landlords will just raise the rent.

That was a very crappy example, but it serves to show the point. Strip away all the nonsense in the situation I described: we aren't actually handing out money to people.

The point remains: if we increase the amount of money people get, sellers of goods and services will just raise their rent to compensate. It seems to me that if more money is being circulated, but the supply of goods doesn't increase, all that happens is you get inflation.

Now, there is the possibility that the increase in money will create a higher supply of goods. In the rent example from above, maybe some people will decide to create new housing to rent. But I don't think that the amount by which supply will increase will offset the effect of inflation. I am guessing inflation will win out.

cqugjep&nfl&Intrinsic_Factors&"Safety play is less dependent on man coverage technique. It's more reading the offense and reacting. CBs have a similar responsibility in zone coverage but in man it's more being able to mirror your man's movement, without being fooled by head shakes, shimmies, false steps, etc. It's a much more reactionary and instinctual thing than watching the play developing in front of you and reacting to it. 

In order to stay with a sub 4.4 40 running WR, a CB needs elite speed and agility (hips). If he has this, most teams are willing to ignore poor tackling ability. A safety is normally playing off and can get by with lower levels of athleticism, with a lot more focus on his mental ability to read the play and tackling to finish it off"

cqugjhp&leagueoflegends&OnlyUpvoteGuy&Honestly, I have had fun dodging (or trying to dodge) them and feel they really bring some needed champion diversity in ARAM.

cqugjhq&todayilearned&MordorsFinest&"People have this false impression that the Romans didn't advance into Scotland, Germany, or Ireland because they couldn't. The great success they had in engagements and punitive raids demonstrated that the Romans could have with relative ease.

However the only reason they kept territories they conquered was by convincing citizens to settle in newly conquered territories. Nobody wanted to live in Scotland so it wasn't conquered. Same with Germany and Ireland. Those were areas that were far away from major trade routes, devoid of any unique resources, the weather was awful and not conducive to their way of life. 

If, however, those areas were pleasant to live in (and if they were there wouldn't have been wave after wave of people migrating into Imperial territories, leading to Hadrian building a wall for instance) chances are if Egypt, Israel, Carthage, The Greek Kingdoms, and Gaul all fell to Rome then so would the Scots, Irish and Germans...If the Romans wanted to live in those countries.

cqugjjd&AskHistorians&ModernKender&The Iranian Hostage Crisis was probably the biggest factor. This was from 1979-1981. 9/11 just refreshed what was already there. Orientalism probably had a big part in this. There existed an idea that Muslims were very different from those of us in the Christian West and so it was pretty easy to become attached to the idea that it was Islam that was responsible for the Iranian Hostage Crisis rather than any political issues. Those feelings were ignited again with 9/11. This is explained in greater detail in [Edward Said's books.](http://www.amazon.com/Edward-W.-Said/e/B001H6V71M)

cqugjku&Baking&nygreenguy&"I have done a lot of testing with stevia. One of the surprising properties is stevia is more hygroscopic than sugar so I found some baked goods are better and more moist with a little stevia mixed in. 

The downsides of stevia is the bitterness and it sucks with texture. The Splenda mix works way better for texture. 

You can try what you want, but I sell my baked goods so I need consistency  which means lots of testing. 

If you are baking, you are also using a lot of fat so I wouldn't worry about calories as much. However, I would say you could substitute up to 1/3 of the sugar with stevia (not the baking mix, but regular stevia) with minimal negatives and possibly more moist than sugar alone."

cqugjkw&leagueoflegends&Reequiem&"hes not talking out of his ass, new cleaver promotes more less skill ceiling champs to be played, and nerfs further champs like Zed or Talon since they cant sit on brutalizer and get a cleaver when they need it. Phage is hella useless and the build path is awkward for every assassin.

Now we will have Gragas/ Sejuani etc (0 skill no brain champs) vs Vi/ Wukong etc which is the same but less tanky and more POINT CLICK cc which makes the game even more annoying to play since not even good reflexes qss save you (hello knockups on every new champ).

I guess Reddit rather have Kassadin midlane than LeBlanc because LeBlanc 'oneshots you' and kassadin does not (see SK vs FNC post-match thread where people cried about Fox oneshotting Steelback with 6 items nashor and 5 drakes).

The thing is this champs take 0 iq to play, 0 decision making and 0 mechanics, every player in the game above gold can get higher ranks just by saying in chat 'pls pick me sej i have all champs' since it gives an advantadge to the team.

He is right, he might not be as polite as le reddit fedoras want, but he is completely right.

And Riot is now buffing Shyvana, Trundle, already buffed Dr. Mundo, Ryze and every champ that can use the new cleaver properly (hello Darius + his ult changes) that make no sense whatsoever, 5.5 was the worst patch that Riot has ever made.

cqugjm5&okc&paper_alien&"I really know nothing about the home ownership scene, I rent, personally.

I can tell you a bit of my opinion on the crime. I've been an OK resident for five years about? I live in the NW quadrant of the city currently, and I'd say it's fine. Edmond and Bethany seem really good too.  Oklahoma city does have some weird stuff. I think some of the high crime rates have to do with a few things: lack of funding for social programs, really harsh crime policies, drug problems, and poverty levels. OKC in particular sits as a major trafficking platform because of the highways. Oklahoma has really harsh crime punishment, and as a fun fact, our incarceration rate for women is twice the national average, and half of oklahoma prisoners are incarcerated for nonviolent and property offenses. We also have about as many slot machines per capita as Nevada. (Does that tie into crime? I have no idea. I just thought about it.) And as far as gang violence goes, I know there are a few, but every large city has em. I've never actually really heard anything about gangs except some coworker talking about it being in the NW 122nd and Pennsylvania Ave. area.

I've lived Edmond, South Side, NW (asian district, plaza district), and in the past **five** years, my and my SO's direct experiences with crime:  
* Saw a fight break out with some homeless dudes next to the shelter.  
* My car was robbed once while I was at the mall, but I accidentally left the doors unlocked, so it was my own fault.  
* My car windows (and several on the street) were shot out back when I lived southside, and the car was egged.  
* Saw a dude get shot in the neck (knew it was a bad neighborhood) by some other dudes he was arguing with late one evening.  
* If you want to count it, I get approached by bozos at the gas station a lot for money.  

I would never say like I've really felt the majority of the city is unsafe. Southside can be a little rough, East side can be rough. I don't know many people who live in those quadrants though. I've heard stories about violent crimes that involve late nights, homeless populations, or occur on the east/south side. I've lived here five years, and I don't think anyone I know would say they think OKC is unsafe. I really like OKC a lot!

cqugjna&LifeProTips&coveredindoghair&"So much this. There's a reason I'll drive to a Honda dealer 30 miles away to pick up fluids/parts, despite living 5 minutes from the largest Honda dealer in the state.

Young and dumb college-me decided I wanted a new (used) car, and looked around for a few weeks. Found one I liked at said giant Honda dealer, called to make sure they had it, and went it to look at it. Oops, it had sold at auction a few days ago. The salesman spent way too long trying to sell me on $10k cars, despite the fact that my upper limit was a firm $5k. That's cool, I didn't really need a new car anyway. But that didn't stop them from calling me everyday for 2 weeks!

Flash forward a few years to when my original POS got rear ended and totaled :( I was on the market for a Civic, so we decided to drop by that dealership. We asked the salesman what they had for under $8k (didn't specify any type of vehicle), and they quickly told us they didn't have any. Never mind the fact that we drove by several of them on our way on! The $8k just wasn't worth it to them.

Went to a dealer across town, and dropped $13k on an awesome Civic. I made damn sure to tell the first place all about the sale they lost. Jerks.

It's good way to start.  You won't feel much power, but you'll learn the wind window and figure out your line management when launching and landing. It's really best to do all that before jumping onto anything 2m+ that will have real juice in the right winds.

btw, 2-line kites are measured by their width across the canopy, and 4-liners are measured by their sq. area.  So the snapshot is 1.4 meters across, but is only a 0.7 sq meter in 4-line terms.

cqugjs0&poker&seamanroses&"I would bet if I knew villain made looser calls to 3-bets. Here's a [sample range](http://i.imgur.com/U1afe2K.png) of what villain could have if we knows he calls with hands like KQs and small pocket pairs. There are some combos removed because we have QQ and there's an ace on the flop, but 30 out of 74 combos in this sample range include an ace or have flopped a set. No matter what we bet, we're not getting those hands to fold. So 40% of the time, he will be calling or raising us. Given that betting half pot is usually a very weak bet size, we could bet 3/5 pot, as this size gives us more fold equity and only has to work 37.5% of the time for us to break even. If he folds all his non-aces and non-sets, which make up 60% of his range, then betting is a profitable play. We could check however, as we have 55% equity against this range. I favor betting, because checking allows villain to bet with almost all his range on the turn, and unless we turn a Q, we probably have to fold.

Edit: If we check back and villain bets the turn, we can call and hope it goes check-check on the river, but if he bets again, we're in a tough spot without a read. It comes down to your knowledge of villain's game and villain's perception of you. To call a turn bet and be able to call down on most rivers, then we need to know how often villain would bluff in this spot. We're crushed by all his value hands, so we would be calling down with a bluff-catcher. Calling the turn and folding the river would likely be more spewy than betting the flop, and to call down the turn, we kind of need to call the river as well (the spewiest line possible), which is why we can't call the turn without a read. Therefore, betting is the best option."

""But this is just plain stupid. You know he has an undefeated record and has won every time by knockout. He has at least 6 inches more of reach than you.""
""So?""
""So for fuck's sake, get it out of your fucking head that you will have any chance against him! You can't take this fight! It's been 4 years since you went to train on the East Coast, you're soft, there are no real fighters out where you've been!"" He's begun hyperventilating at this point. He doesn't even get this worked up when he coaches me, something is not right. ""What else is the problem?""
""What do you fucking mean the other problem? The problem is you'll lose!"" He's lying, he keeps pacing and playing with his watch.
""Why are you so against it?"" He stops pacing and looks at me. The look on his face is something I have never seen before and never will see again. His face showed a feeling of loss, depression, like something had broken inside of him. Sighing he sat down on the locker room bench across from me. Elbows on the knees of his sweatpants, his hands clasped in front of his face as if praying to god. Another long sigh and he starts his story.
""I wasn't always a boxing trainer. I used to work with monsters. Underground fighters all over the world would come to learn how to kill someone in a ring.""
This was a side of him I had seen before many matches ago. A side that had seen hell and created its demons.
""I found him while traveling the slums of India looking for fighters. I was looking for desperate men, the kind who have nothing and don't care, the kind that don't treat people like human beings. I wasn't looking for a kid. But I found one. A kid who had eyes that had seen things that no one should see.""
""How did you know he was going to be a fighter?""
""He came up to me and asked for change. One of the other trainers, Ed thought it would be funny to kick him in the face. Ed kicked out, the kid saw it, swayed to his inside and threw an uppercut that crushed Ed's balls. Ed went down and we were left there stunned. Without missing a beat, the kid started going through his pockets, rifling for valuables and money. When he was done he stood up and smiled at us and asked 'Change?'.""
""So you took him in and trained him?""
He nodded, ""I took a young boy, an innocent boy which fate had screwed over. And I raised him to fight, to win, to kill...He is my sin, and now the only reason he wants this fight is so he can prove that he's the best. Not you, or anyone else I've trained. I am begging you,"" He looked up at me, staring at me with teary eyes, ""don't fight him, you won't just lose the fight. You'll most likely die. Like I said, you've gotten soft. 4 years ago you stood a chance. Now? No way, no fucking way."""

cqugjux&scotus&TiredofInsanity&"There are a lot of places where plural Marraige and same-sex Marraige present different legal challenges.  Marraige is a contract between two people.  The contract law behind this goes deep and would have to be worked out anew for plural marraige.

Let's deal with just one of these cases: survivorship.  Our laws deal with survivorship in a marraige assuming 1survivor.  A person can elect when starting social security to have dual survivorship so the SS is paid at a lower rate but is paid for the life of the person and the spouse.  

With plural marriage I could marry perhaps a woman and her daughter, claim SS with survivorship and expect both them to receive my check after I die for the length of both lives.  

This is a loophole that would have to be addressed; perhaps with a step down table reducing the amount further for each additional spouse, but whatever the answer, there is a bigger change of law required to adjudicate the variations possible with plural marraige.  "

cqugjvz&USMC&Durkdorkgilgamesh&"Corry's current group punishment was after an underaged 21 stole and crashed a golf cart in fort Walton. The golf cart owners pressed charges, and because the dollar amount is over some threshold, its grand theft auto.  He did all this without his buddy.

So they've got him on breaking the libo order, underage drinking, dui, and grand theft auto. The investigation found he was one of at least 9 Marines who were breaking the libo order that weekend. 

Group punishment sucks, and I've seen it abused at Corry. Capt Cooper and MGySgt Flynn are distinguished examples. Going through here as a JCACr now, I think the students don't know how easy they've got it. Try four months secured to base in cammies, with GySgt Eyre as your Platoon Commander. 

The current punishment seems fitting. I don't know what else could be as effective for a group of entry level students. There is/was a blatant and shared disregard for TECOM CGs libo policy. 

But Marines prefer bitching. So I'll join in.

cqugjw6&zenfone2&ShaidarHaran2&"Fast charging works by two way communication between the charger and the battery, the battery will assess the state of each of its individual cells, and tell the charger about their charge level, temperature, and wear state. The lower the charge and temperature, the faster it can be charged without damage. There is also wear leveling between cells.  
 
Fast charging doesn't reduce overall battery life by much overall because of this. It's just opportunistic. If you had a dumb charger with that much wattage, yes, it would damage the battery, but the way this works, not so much.

cqugjxa&French&swabrero&"it can be difficult. i live in Melbourne; i finished my french classes last year. You do see the occasional french backpacker here when you're out on the piss but other than that, it's slim pickings really. Of course there are meetups, as people have mentioned, and there is the alliance française, but as a 21 year old dude i feel a bit out of place... from what I've seen, these sorts of things are mostly enjoyed by middle aged women. 

So, to study, I mostly read. I read novels and the news for at least an hour or two every day. I would strongly recommend 'liking' some french news outlets on Facebook. tv5monde is great because it's a 24 hour news channel that you can stream. I also listen to a lot of music in French and it can be great to help you learn! Gainsbourg, Brel, Hardy, Dutronc... there is so much great francophone music.

cqugk01&atheism&BuccaneerRex&"Sorry, it was a good setup for the joke. 

Parental relationships should not stay in a dominance mode. It's not that you're disrespecting them, you're just not agreeing with them. You can treat them the way you'd treat any other family member you disagree with. Your relationship with your parents is your own, and only you know them and can judge their moods, etc. But it's important to remember that they're not really authorities on anything, not even you. Arguments can only really exist if both people have it. I am not pretending it's easy, but you can simply agree to disagree. Usually that means ignoring anything they say that pisses you off, but that's something you often have to do with family. Getting heated is the cue to end the conversation and walk away. Interacting with your parents as an independent adult can range from no interaction at all to creepy. You're not smarter than your parents, but they aren't smarter than you, just older. You have different lives because you've had different experiences. 

Even if they won't try, peace can be found through understanding. Your understanding of them. Pretending to believe what they believe will fail, but accepting that they do in fact believe it will help you. Your job isn't to argue them out, or reason them in to any new beliefs. You just need to accept that they do believe crazy things and that those crazy beliefs will influence their behaviors. 

Ask them questions. Why is it so important to them that you do certain things? Why do they believe what they believe? Don't make it a confrontation, try to let it stay a conversation. Keep it clear that you are trying to have the exchange as an adult, not as their daughter. 

YMMV on this advice. "

cqugk1c&asianamerican&PopePaulFarmer&"that's a super generalized understanding of how the Communists seized power. people weren't pissed at land owners, they were pissed about power relations and given sufficient tools to shape the political and economic landscape to their own, they found all sorts of just-so rationales to do so. 'historical grudges' was, at the provincial level, a superficial ploy to seize land and wealth and political power. Mao may have believed his own ideals but the practical reality was that this allowed for Communist cadre to completely usurp local holdings with the promise that they would soon be the ones who were the community leaders, builders, and bankers

why do you think corruption is so systemic to the Chinese system? if people were really about grudges and wealth inequality then fuck me, you'd think China would at least be reasonably equitable but it's a far sight from what you'd call an egalitarian society. my great grandparents died in labor camps and my mother's side lost a fuckload of land and holdings during the revolt. and you can bet your ass that those holdings were not redistributed fairly to the community and you can bet your ass that my great grandparents weren't thrown in labor camps for ideology so much as their community standing

come up with the justifications that you want to to rationalize your bad argument but please don't believe this fairy tale rendition of Chinese history"

He's not narcissistic though. At least, not for his age. That's just how we all were at that age. It just seems narcissistic because we outgrew it."
cqugk1x&pcmasterrace&doug_peck&"Basically I ran with a crew of a few guys that got themselves into shit over and over again, after they got two different camps raided and destroyed in the span of two weeks I decided to branch out. (An example was that the leader of the group, Juicy, was threatening Spartan before I knew him to pick me up from the coast after I died)

The server was relatively small and the owner was a cool guy, I was on the coast and he moved a Military offroad to me (Which I dubbed Sasha) and told me they were having a BBQ in the bottom left of the map, they brought two Urals full of food and guns. Set up barricades, and set up some campfires.

I drove over there and some ass took potshots at us as I drove near to the point and I just gunned it there. While there I met someone who was typing in a convincingly russian manner. He told me that there were a couple of stray tents that people abandoned long ago near his base. After the BBQ we were driving out of town and someone popped out with a rifle and took shots at us.

This russian guy hopped out of the car, and with a M16 in burst fire put so many rounds into the bandit so quickly I thought he had a M249. Bandaged, got back in his car, and lead us to the base near gorka.

Turns out that that guy was Spartan using an alias, and for the next couple of weeks I operated with him looting, hoarding, looting, hoarding. Fucking about, the norm. And eventually I logged on one day and all my shit was fucked except my car.

After I got hit a few times I got on with an alias and met Spartan near Novy and I told him that someone was burning me and that shit was fucked. Spartan and I ended up using aliases and basing up west of Pobeda dam, while at the prep for another BBQ one of the guys from Juicy’s group told the moderator about how they “stole some kids stuff, and killed him five times playing it off as accidents and bandits” 

After that we weren't bothered as the server pretty much died, but after people who I had been friends with for a couple of months stabbed me in the back and felt no remorse left me with some trust issues and Spartan was the only people I could trust. We fell out of contact for about nine months until I started playing War Thunder and contacted him again. We've been playing together since.

TL:DR friends stabbed me in the back, Spartan stood with me through it all, and I know I can trust him.

This all happened around 2013 starting in September so my memory is a bit foggy about it all, but that's the gyst of it."

I don't ""play"" the RTS anymore, and I certainly don't check in on my ATs anymore (I almost threw my monitor out my window the last time I did that). I just send my cheap ATs at the nearest enemy capital and never look back--just so my soldier gets experience. Using actual, important ATs is nothing but frustration and wasted time.

I honestly don't know what I expected from a F2P game, but I should have realized the trolling would be functioning at epic levels.

  - First result: 4K footage. Only 30 FPS.
  - 2nd, 3rd result: title claims 1440p 60 FPS, and that's probably what they were recording at. YouTube's quality options only go up to 1080p 60FPS however.
  - 4th and 5th result: title also claims to be 1440p 60 FPS, but unlike the previous ones, they are available at 1440p. Only 30 FPS however.

As far as I know, anything above 1080p will not support 60 FPS on YouTube's end; they will downgrade your footage to either 1080p 60 FPS, or 30 FPS."

I untie my Pokemon bath robe and let the flaps open up and fall to my sides. The long, purple object protrudes 3 feet ahead, like an yardstick being waved by an angry teacher at a misbehaved student. I gaze at the wall covered in framed pictures and decide which one will receive my reward. 

I began to work my hands down the object taking care to caress the forward grip and tickle the compensator. I slowly run my tongue around the rim of the 4x scope only teasing the glass, never touching it. Unable to restrain myself further I begin wildly alternating between ADS and hip fire, faster and faster until finally I depress the trigger one time.

cqugk3y&TheRedPill&_whistler&"First off, only you have all the requisite information to make the right call here.  I can only give you my opinion.

That being said, it sound like she's in a fairly constant state of comfort testing.  You've demonstrated the Alpha Attraction qualities, she's seeking the Beta Comfort qualities that let her know if she can trust you.

As the first child of three, she'll probably shoulder responsibility fairly well.  This is also evidenced by her willingness and aptitude at fulfilling domestic duties.

She doesn't spend as much time as she should cultivating her own self esteem; she relies on validation from others - you, specifically - to fill this void.  This is most women, so it's not a deal breaker.  I get this from the info about her room and bathroom - the household areas that most represent her - being a mess, and the info about not taking care of her body and health.  Possessions provide part of this external validation, as well.  But materialism is a primarily feminine quality, so once again, not a deal breaker.

You've (apparently very bluntly) told her that if she doesn't get her act straight, you're out.  This is a failure of the comfort test, but can be a passing score for shit testing.  Although I'm generally against bluntly stating the truth to women - implication is your friend - it can work with some, and with her being a firstborn it's more likely to work with her.

You've really got to figure out where her head is at to know how to proceed.

I'd start building up the comfort if I were you.  Gauge her response to this.  You seem like you're being honest with yourself, so as long as you're willing to bear the pain if you build comfort - making yourself more vulnerable - and it still doesn't work out, I think this is the best course.

*edited to add*: With all this, I can't condone pursuing a monogamous LTR.  You're 25, you've got a decade before you should really be pursuing the stasis of a family dynamic.  But you know your own head, and I don't, so there it is."

cqugk5e&news&yabbadabbajustdont&"I said parents are on the entitlement train, not schools.

You are trying to create an argument that parents, because they pay taxes, etc., should be able to violate the school's attendance policy. And anyone like me, who feels otherwise, is compared to Nazis.

Let me explain something to you. School policies are put into place not by administrators, but by school boards. School boards consist of elected citizens, much like the Legislative Branch of the United States government. These citizens are elected by their peers, to decide on and implement policies, with the best interests of their constituents. 

If this father, or any parent, has a problem with the policies of their elected officials, they can't simply violate those policies. They have to suck it up, and play along, with the hope that one day, they can get elected to the school board, or get one or more of their friends elected.

 I don't like having a speed limit on the highway, but the officials that have been elected in my area have deemed that to be the safest option. Paying taxes does not allow me to drive 100mph.

This attitude is commonly known as entitlement."

Claiming this as a reason for not wanting children is nothing like saying you don't want kids because they cost a fortune, constantly shit themselves and generally drain the life from their parents.

If someone were to say that they don't want dogs and referred to one of any number of the vicious dog attacks that occur every day as their reasoning, I suspect that a few of us here (myself included) would see a problem with that logic.

I guess I just don't see the point in posts like these, other than to say ""See!? Look! Kids are **evil!**"". But kids aren't generally evil, and so this isn't a good reason to be child-free, IMO."

cqugk6d&BF_Hardline&ChaoticNeutralCop&I'd love to see a longer game of blood money any day, but I feel the game mode itself is perhaps more dependent on team competency  than any other barring the squad style rescue/crosshair. Unlike crosshair/conquest/TDM, you rarely if ever have a close game of blood money, one team usually establishes a lead and then runs with it. I'd personally like to see a high ticket blood money server if only to see if the matches are one-sided due to the game mode or due to the time/ticket limit of the normal matches. I can't see round timer being an issue on blood money, but I'd say increase both!

cqugkah&sysadmin&Enphuego&"I'd go back to your boss and tell him that you did some research and realized that you were in way over your head.

The current environment is a mess, what you are proposing is complicated and you don't really have the expertise to do it right.  If it fails, you'll take the blame and be responsible for fixing it and it doesn't sound like you are getting paid any extra.  It's a recipe for disaster and the only blame in this situation lies with your boss.

If you do go down this path, what you want is the *simplest* solution possible.  I'd forget about virtualization and just install multiple roles on one install of Server 2012.  Raid 1 is good (I'd get 4 disks and do Raid 1+0 personally). I'd go ahead and order a hard drive to serve as a hot spare.  It's not strictly necessary but it will buy you some time to replace a failed HDD and reduce the risk that you'll lose data.

You'll need to set the SQL server to back up to file and you'll need another job to clean up the old backups.  I'd use something like Acronis TrueImage to create a full backup image of your server (maybe monthly?) and keep your files sync'd to the cloud.  You'll need to make sure that the backup image somehow gets stored at an offsite location.  Storing the backups on the same server on a different disk does not protect against viruses, malicious actions or physical destruction.

A simple router should be able to handle DHCP and 5 PCs plus a server.  I don't have any recommendations, but I'd look for something that's at the high end of the consumer line.

Forget all about standardized printing - just install the printer on all 5 PCs.

Price out 5 new PCs for the office, make sure they have SSDs.  They may cost a little extra, but it's guaranteed to make everyone happy with performance.  They should probably be Windows 8.1 at this point, but make sure that any software needed for the business will run on it.  If you've got the budget, back up at least the files on those PCs as well.

Retire the other domains and get down to a single domain (you can use dcpromo to take over from the old server and retire it but honestly this is a more advanced task).  Put the new PCs in the single domain and assign permissions to the share and PCs using those accounts.

As for Office and Outlook - use Office365.  It's pretty cheap and you won't need an Exchange server.

If you've followed the above advice, you'll have a relatively simple environment that can be brought back from nearly any disaster."

cqugkbe&AskReddit&forkinanoutlet&"I had a teacher tell me I would ""fail at life,"" that I was ""a detestable little shit"" and some other legitimately upsetting shit because I didn't enjoy the book we were reading (well, to be fair, I was kind of a little shit as well, but it was uncalled for). I left class and went to the park to read in the sun, and came back for my next class.

The vice-principal was this wannabe hardass who had buzzed his hair and bleached it, which gave him the weird appearance of Eminem wearing a suit. He sneaks up behind me as I'm walking down the hall and bellows ""Going somewhere?"" before dragging me down to his office.

He sits me down in his chair and starts this whole intimidation routine, telling me that I have potentially ruined my entire high school career (I'm in grade 9 at this point, by the way), that I'm probably going to be expelled and have to go to a reformatory school, and then he starts interrogating me on my drug use and family situation; basically just going bizarrely over the line considering all I did was skip class.

I told him what she said and he didn't back off; started saying shit like ""I'm sure you misinterpreted that, there's no way she said that, did anybody hear her say that?"" When I told him that the entire class of around 30 kids had heard it, his face turned white and he just told me to go to my next class.

That teacher didn't look me in the eye for the rest of the year, never asked me a single question and didn't do anything regarding my piss-poor attendance. I passed the class with a 65 or 70, though I definitely should have failed.

In all honesty, from that point on, I was more interested in manipulating the teachers that treated me like shit instead of actually putting effort into their classes. I scraped by several of my classes with a 51% using blackmail after they snapped and said something shitty about me.

I dropped out of standard high school in grade 12 and went to an alternative school to finish up. When I got my university acceptance letters, I definitely went back to my old high school - both to thank the teachers who believed in me and helped me, and to show the teachers who acted like dicks to me how wrong they were about me. It might seem petty, but it felt pretty good telling that bitch who told me I would fail at life that I absolutely wouldn't. I also called her a sallow, reptilian bitch before leaving.

Okay, maybe I was a detestable little shit, but she could have been nicer about it."

cqugkbn&malefashionadvice&casechopper&Newsboy/flat caps, cowboy hats, fedoras, berets and panamas. There are all kinds of hats out there. If you poll MFA you won't find too many venturing outside ballcaps and beanies. Ball caps provide little sun protection which is one of the only utilitarian reasons to wear a hat. They're ubiquitous, draw little attention, usually carry some kind of slogan and work nicely as the graphic T or Dad jeans of headwear.  Beanies are great for keeping your head warm when it's cold. Why limit yourself to only 2 forms of headwear?  If you look at how people are dressed in NYC or other major cities you'll find a lot of variety in headwear, a lot of it worn very well.

Your presence is needed.** Andrew stands from where he is sitting and walks straight to where Blake has just passed the boundary, moving at a pace that is slightly faster than normal. Just slightly. He approaches the son of Darkness, still smiling genuinely, but his eyes cold and analytical.*  
Greetings. *he gestures deferently, a slight bow, or perhaps a nod, accompanied by the slight extension of his left hand, which is somewhere in between closed and open.

cqugkem&AskReddit&talonofdrangor&This was in high school, and she was a Spanish teacher. We had a lot of class clowns in that class, and since this was Spanish 2, she knew a lot of them. There was this one such class clown (Kid A) who broke his arm and had it in a cast. One day, he had it resting on top of the desk. Another class clown (Kid B) threw a paper airplane toward Kid A's direction from the other side of the classroom. The teacher turned around and saw the airplane and got mad at Kid A for throwing it, despite the fact that it was flying towards him. Kid A, and the rest of the class, tried to defend him by saying that he didn't throw it; his arm was on the desk because he was resting it there, not because he threw it. She didn't believe any of us and thought we were all fucking with her, so she started ranting about pass incidents. She blamed us for the paperwork she lost and said she found our tests in the recycling, and that one of us must have done it. I think she got mad because we were all denying it and trying to cover for one another. So in the end she called us all little shits, and then told Kid A to leave the classroom to go to the detention room.

You also may have a controlled attack style that Benefits attack, str, and Def at the same time but at the cost of lesser exp quantities.

cqugkgl&ACON_Support&just_ewe_left&"Thank you.

1) It is a small business run off (don't laugh too hard) Excel workbooks.  I have copies.  Customer phone numbers, purchase dates, etc. - all regular business records directly saved.  What I had that was obviously suspect or wrong I document scanned with my phone and copied with a scanner/printer.  Redundancy :)  I was a great employee for reasons like that lol.

3) I was planning on showing up early tomorrow to photograph, but now that I'm home I realize she may be planning on showing up early because she wants to put on this whole front for the sales rep.  I'm going to head back tonight to photograph and grab my phone charger.  Then everything will be out except my candy bowl and a few business cards - I cleaned out the mini fridge today and everything.

4) I never had the documentation - NBoss has a LOT of things sent directly to her other store... cuz managing the day-to-day there doesn't mean she won't also micromanage me over the phone.  Or at least try really hard to do both... in reality, nothing gets done unless I can do it or I spend three days reminding her.

As far as the IRS goes: I have form... umm... it's not in front of me but I think it's SS-8 pretty much filled out with supporting documentation (paychecks - actual paper copies cuz I e-deposited - that say ""wage + commission"" or ""salary + commisson"" and a bunch of other stuff)...

but I that form is supposed to be the one you fill out if you're not sure if you're a contractor or employee according to their website.  And I couldn't figure out if there was a different way to just straight up report her?  

She dropped the form on me two weeks before the tax deadline, and I made sure my taxes aren't overdue, and figured I'd just wait until after tax season since it was looking like I might actually have to call them?

Thank you for the reassurance.

I did not get that in writing when it originally happened.  I did tape the phone call where I confronted her about it a couple days ago, in which I mentioned that she had told me that.  She tries to evade for a bit, then says she'll evaluate it on a case by case basis, then after I say it sounds like a scam she blows up, then melts down, and finally says ""Well then they all have warranties, why is this even an issue? They all have warranties!  Can we move on already?!?""  

She called me back five minutes later to ask, ""What brought all this on?"" and says ""This is none of your business.  You won't get in trouble for this; I will.""

I should trust people less, I guess... "

* Case sensitivity is user preference.

* Yes, VB.NET is unique in its syntax, but  that's not necessarily a bad thing. In my opinion learning a different syntax can make you a better programmer. 

* a+=1 easy 

* Source? I typically see job listings for .NET developers instead of specifically stating one over the other.

* How so? 

* Regions are available in VB.NET. I'm pretty sure this is just a Visual Studio feature.

What's he supposed to do, unzip his pants and show off his genitals? Yeah, him unzipping his pants is gonna end *real well* in that scenario.

Not to mention the inverse, how badly trans women get treated in male bathrooms, what with the high rates of sexual harassment, verbal abuse, and physical assault.

cqugkmm&CasualConversation&AuthenticSpace&What's it pay?
cqugkmn&Warthunder&Thejes2&He's at level 5... Tier II at most...
cqugkmo&explainlikeimfive&Mephysteaux&Yes, but the amount of inflation won't be proportional to the wage increase. Plenty of goods and services have some minimum wage employees involved with them. For instance, when you buy a $20 DVD, part of the money you're paying goes towards the salaries of the cashier, the store janitors, etc. So, if those people get paid more, stores have to charge more to cover the extra labor costs. But if you double their pay, the DVD won't cost $40, maybe it will cost $25. That's because part of that money also goes to the factory in China that produced the physical disc, and the actors who produced the movie. They are not tied to the minimum wage, so the amount of money they receive shouldn't increase.

cqugkmt&changemyview&Riahlize&Sure, people can't always get their dream job. But no one is forcing them to work at Hooters specifically. In my home state, there is a bikini coffee shop (actually there are multiple). You guessed it, only women work there... in bikini's, year round. They're also not forced to work there. They applied for that job. I understand jobs are difficult to get sometimes, especially ones you enjoy or want to pursue, so you settle for a while or for the long run. But you still get a say. I'm a woman who has never worked at Hooters, and I've had plenty of other jobs. I chose not to. Being degraded is losing your self-respect, your dignity or being humiliated. If they're choosing that, that's really their problem and not a problem to women as a whole.
cqugkmu&AskReddit&TheEmaculateSpork&"Eh, but that can be valid. There are certain skills that should just be taught by schools because it's the best way to make sure that important information is taught to most people.

All I needed to do was die and I could have carried with ease. This of course was on Assault, but it happens in conquest too. Where one person may be doing bad and then others, without looking at the rest, agree. Those surrenders are by far the worst feeling ones for the person fed. If mid and solo do bad, they don't even care what the hunter does sometimes and just surrender.

Want more trans representation in comics? Don't start your own comic. Force a company to make a trans character for you. Bonus points if you demand they make an already established character trans and stick it to the fans of said character. 

Want more black movies? Don't go make films. Force a studio to make black films for you. Again, bonus points if you can get them to bend the race of an already established franchise.

cqugkta&Scotch&Brian_MB_05&"Hi all, here's one batch of Bowmore that I wasn't terribly keen on, the Tempest Batch 5. I've mentioned in a few other posts that it's not nearly as good at the 3rd batch, and I'd say I prefer the 12 to this one also. However here are my more specific thoughts about it.

**Nose**: alcohol, rotting fruit (cherry or strawberry), some caramel hiding in behind

well that is a bit off putting...

**Palate**: alcohol, weird fruit notes - not in a good way, like rotting apples in the fall

**Finish**: lingering, all of that rotting apple *not* goodness sticking around

**60**/100

revisit with press - 1/2tsp water to 1oz

**Nose**: pears, caramel, brine, light peat

**Palate**: peat, indistinguishable fruit

**Finish**: funky ash, plum

Overall, very improved with the press! Still not a great dram, not one I would want regularly, but much better than what it was.

**75**/100"

cqugkvn&summonerschool&A_Wild_Okapi&"Ziggs and Orianna have passives that make CSing easier. Malzahar is very easy to farm with once you buy some AP and have a few points in his E. For other AP champions, consider taking the Butcher and Arcane Blade masteries to deal more damage to minions. Other than that, it really does just come down to practicing in custom games or play norms where your goal is to *only* CS while avoiding harass and unfavorable trades. CSing in PvP will become second-nature the more you practice in PvE or a game without any distractions.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/204xyb/learn_to_cs_like_a_challenger_with_elyndar_a/) is a guide you should check out. It's worth at least skimming but also very helpful if you go through it. There's also a CSing infographic floating around out there; I'll edit this comment if I find it.

cqugkwh&skyrimmods&FaithfulChaos&"Brumbek handled himself very poorly here. He steered the conversation towards talking about harassment to the point it devolved into it being the spotlight after the hour mark. Good job on TB's part for at least trying to moderate it early on by saying this was irrelevant to the topic at hand and calling out Polygon for invoking the same method for their article's headline, but the SMIM author definitely led everyone by the nose. Very disappointed that they missed out on discussing the 25%-75% split because of this.

First, you don't get to categorize all modders as either being neutral or fully supportive of this plan. Acting as if it was only the players that were complaining about having paid mods was disingenuous and only served to help the next point.

Do not start labeling people as ""not part of the community"" because of criteria #1, #2, #3, etc. There was a lot of ""external activity"", as you call it, because this was an issue that would have far reaching ramifications on the gaming industry. As Robin brought up, the backlash was inevitable given the current climate of paid content acting as a crutch for the base game and how easily it could be exploited by publishers and development companies.

The attitude towards these peoples' opinions was disgusting, Brumbek. Calling people ""terrorists"" is a good way of alienating someone who may have been on your side to begin with. Weigh the merits of the points people bring up before knocking them down without consideration. If you let extremists color your perception of an argument, then yes, this same backlash will happen again because more and more people will become fed up having not been listened to.

There was also a lot of flip-flopping on Brumbek's part throughout the interview, mostly in regards to Valve, along with a lot of fake humbleness, though I'll just chalk it up to natural artist pride. As a modder, though, I've lost a great deal of respect for him.

Robin and TB on the other hand did decent work. Thanks for the interview guys."

Do you think it's possible that's the reason why Water White is such a deplorable person and as George said, 'a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros' is *because* Walt isn't pure adulterated evil? What I mean is that, in way, I look at someone like Walt as worse than a Joffrey because we know that Walt is capable of being a good person.  For someone to 'break bad' in a way, is almost more 'evil' than someone whose heart and soul are dark and evil from the get-go.  It's like, we don't expect any better from Joffrey whereas Walt has sunk to personal lows far below whatever moral lines he had set for himself prior to the show.  I hope that makes sense.  "

cqugkxj&Drugs&Badman2&Tripping at a festival. Everybody was like Whoa dude check out those Northern Lights. I saw shimmering crazy lights, decided it was just me tripping, because everything was shifty. Told them, no, that's just a car dealership down the road and some light pollution. Turns out to really be the Northern Lights, and I dismissed them. Then I cut my finger, and my friend's girlfriend, starts to suck the blood from my finger, right in front of him, in an overtly sexual way. I was too awkward to know how to respond to that particular bodily fluid transfer so I just froze unable to compute. That wasn't as weird as the time we saw a UFO tripping on the beach, but that's not as interesting really because there were no abductions, just a weird silent bright light hovering above us for a second before flying away.
cqugkxk&nfl&Crook_Shank&Last minute trades. They have the time, might as well use it. 
cqugkxl&exmormon&YoungModern&"For example the girls camps are often ""modesty"" camps where the activities are centred around socially shaming the dress and appearance of young girls, often pre-pubescent. They also relentlessly hammer chastity and place the blame of temptation on the girls for being ""walking pornography"" who tempt the boys. They also have activities like [this one](http://i.imgur.com/Eoz9JZa.jpg) where the hammer that their sole worth in life is as a wife and mother. Little so the girls know that they won't even be able to properly see their dress once the [temple vestments](http://youtu.be/6udew9axmdM) have been placed over them.

And for the boys it's not about the wonders of creation. It's all Nakuru following the righteous example of Book of Mormon characters and pioneer ancestors who ""honour their priest"" and about relentlessly hammering into them the importance of serving a full two-year mission where they follow all of the rules and the grave consequences and social ostracism of failing to do so.

cqugkyk&cars&Dirtyace&"They are legit.  If you replace 1 side and the other side has any significant wear you should do both.  That's with a normal car.  Now you have a Camaro SS which means it most likely has a limited slip rear, you must always replace those rears at the same time as differences in height from side to side will cause premature wear and failure of that dif.  The clutches in it will burn up if they are always wearing on one another. Also performance tires wear out by 15 to 20 k with easy driving.  I was going through tires every 10 to 12 k on my corvette driving it like it should be driven.

cqugl0p&options&[deleted]&iv and skew in my mind are two separate things.  a single implied volatility often refers to the iv of the atm strike.  skew is how that iv is represented in the otm strikes above and below spot.  skew morphs over time but it's general structure stays intact.  for SPY that would be negative IV the higher you get in calls and higher IV the lower you get with puts. 
cqugl0q&kratom&WhosCountin&Hmm, interesting... I've felt kind of the opposite effect over the last week or two, but I've also cut out weed and porn, hence the kratom - I get less fucked up and high off of it, but it totally gets rid of the horrible way I feel when quitting weed after months of smoking multiple times per day. I've felt sharper and more motivated and just more present, but this is a good warning. I'm taking around 4-5g when I get home from work (8-9pm) to combat my adderall comedown from the day and stave off the desire to smoke or watch porn and get up the motivation to do things. I've had ADHD since I was a little kid and really don't function well at work without adderall, but it does make me feel like death when I'm off the clock and meds. Weed was my solution, but it was giving me terrible anhedonia and was making me slow and out of it and anti-social even towards my best friends. Plus being high that often just isn't that fun anymore and wastes so much time. Kratom seemed to be a good middle ground, but now I'm worried. Rrrghhhhh fucking concentration

Ronia + Beelz pairings can handle Legend Plus, and doesn't require any more +egg investment than most teams do.

Assuming Ronia is his primary team, he needs to counter the things she's bad at: skill binds (Andromeda leads pack 80% and so does this fine), Fire or Dark absorbs/binds (Andromeda has nothing to worry about here), needing heavy damage every single turn (Andromeda is NOT good at this).

Light Kali can handle the third as a tertiary team, but I see no reason to worry about Andromeda.  Her big weaknesses (combo guard, water binds/absorbs, longer dungeons) aren't problems for Ronia, so his two main teams cover each other well."

It would take me 7-15hrs per boat depending on how well the previous technician before me did their job.

cqugl4u&prisonarchitect&ashella&Are there areas of your prison that do have uniforms and only part of it isn't getting them? Are your janitors leaving laundry baskets with clean or dirty uniforms in them in areas your workers aren't permitted to? I previously had a problem where I would build my main prison, and then I'd build a smaller area for the protective custody prisoners, including their own laundry area. However, all the delivered uniforms would go to my main area's laundry room (it seems uniform deliveries always go to the first laundry you build) leaving none for the protective area. I would end up having to zone the area that wasn't getting uniforms to shared so that the workers from the main laundry area could go put uniforms on the beds. Since then, when I'm building, I always make sure to leave new areas un-zoned until a worker or janitor comes in and puts uniforms on all the beds (and hopefully leaves behind a laundry basket with some extras in it) so that uniforms stay evenly distributed.

cqugl5j&AskReddit&firo_sephfiro&"I don't know why people feel the need to throw around the term strawmen so loosely. This isn't a strawman argument at all. The original comment was linguistically ignorant and ethnocentric so someone called them out on it. That's not getting butthurt for having a different opinion, it's called being an intelligent critical-thinker. We ridicule climate change deniers because they are ignorant about science. Well guess what? Linguistics is a science so if you're going to be ignorant about it you can expect to be ridiculed.


The sole purpose of language is to use words to communicate ideas, and African American Vernacular English works as sufficiently as any other language. You can understand the meaning of the statement ""it do be cold"", therefore the words are conveying the idea properly. If you are asserting that they are not proper, then you will have to come up with a better definition of language than the entire scientific community that studies linguistics. 


If you want to assert that you prefer the King's English, that's fine. But don't act like other languages are inferior because that's pure fallacy and not supported by any evidence whatsoever. And please refrain from calling something a fallacy just because you don't like it. It's fucking ignorant. "

1 tonne = 2,204.64 pounds

2,204.64 pounds of lift = 96,171.14 newtons. Therefore we would need 96,171.14 watts (at 1n/W which seems quite optimistic) to generate lift on a car, would we not?

The highest capacity battery pack available at the moment that I know of is the Tesla S battery pack at 85kW. Assuming the 85kW could power the engine(which it can't), it would last approximately 45 minutes.

This doesn't take into consideration many, many other factors such as the safety of having a battery powered car run out of juice at 10,000 feet.

I could be completely wrong on my math, because I don't know much about physics, but the practically of flying cars is just not there, and likely never will be."

Also, trans people tend to pass when they switch locker rooms, so they tend to be more at risk going into the locker rooms they look like they shouldn't be entering. 

Allowing transgender people to use the facilities they want cuts down on harassment issues (but will not eliminate it, as I've said before) and is generally safer for everyone involved.

The fact that I can still see the lines of edges of the sod make me believe the sod wasn't installed properly anyway.

Sod is mostly dead. Final answer. 

You could try reseeding to fill in the bare spots if you dont want to tear it all up but im not sure when the best time for you to do that is. You may also have a problem with your soil which would may have cause the sod to die in the first place and could prevent seed from germinating in the future.

I suggest a soil test and try to get some info from someone that knows more about lawn care in your area."

In the Knox example - she could definitely be eradicated, but it's not a sure thing for Italy if they try. There's a provision in the treaty with Italy that says that America is not automatically obliged to extradite if she has a constitutional protection (double jeopardy) but it doesn't exclude the possibility.


In the second case most definitely he could be extradited. Freedom of the Press only applies for what you do on American soil. Depending on the country a request for extradition for a ""treason"" offence would either be close to absolutely certain (for close allies) or a massive political hot potato (for no so close allies / outright enemies). 

And yes they all have very convoluted language put in place to deal with these exact sort of situations.

My second pick is the Aliens, because 4 for 1 stealth fighters is a steal. I'm a little worried that the Predator has his built in nuke, though, so this is going to be a road trip. Good luck everybody else!

Edit: After reading /u/Reilic 's educational piece on the wheezing General, I think I've got to pick the same strategy. Dropping the Aliens, picking up Grievous.

cquglce&electronic_cigarette&vaporgalleryaustin&"For any device that uses a single 18650, such as the IPV Mini 2, Sigelei 50W V2 and Mini, etc, using the onboard charging is A-OK. What you want to avoid is using the on-board charging for any device that uses two or more 18650 batteries. 

When you've got multiple battery cells in a device, both cells have to be charged at an equal rate in order to be charged safely -- this is called load balancing. Most multi-cell devices on the market are bad at load balancing, which can lead to cells being charged unevenly. Best-case scenario this just means one battery is charged sooner than the other, but worst-case scenario this can cause the fuller cell to discharge into the other, causing the cells to overload and catastrophically fail."

I was always anti-war and pro-drug legalization, against police abuse and in favor of free markets. I stayed the same on the issues, I simply came to realize that the Democrat leadership were insincere, and that men like Ron Paul and Patrick Buchanan really meant it.

We agree about the demographics, that is why the main issue I disagree with other Republicans on is immigration. We need to find a way to have softer borders and better treated immigrants. We can't have a welfare state for everyone on earth who wants to move here, but people who can fill a job that Americans can't or won't ought to be welcome. 

Our Washington insiders live in a crowded place, but much of the west is empty and rural. Maybe we can make a compromise: immigrate to North Dakota with ease, but immigrate to NYC with a *lot* more difficulty.

Bottom line: Racism ought not be a Republican issue, and we need to remove racial and other ""identity"" politics and put the focus on the issues (where I sincerely think most people agree)."

When I stretched to a 14g all I felt was a slight pinch and that was it. As for being nauseous,  it's just your nerves. When I first started I was super nervous I would mess up and felt the same way.

cquglh0&piano&tiredmaligator&"Yep. I practiced for a couple weeks before the audition with the pieces that I had already learned with my previous teacher, and the audition itself was maybe 15 minutes. I played a little bit of each piece, answered some questions about myself, and then I got the email that I wasn't accepted. Then later that evening, they sent me another email saying that a teacher had opened up a spot in her studio if I was still interested, so that is how I squeaked into a piano minor. I auditioned right before my last three semesters of college, so I really had to get in that semester or else I wouldn't be getting a minor at all, but if you have more leeway, definitely take more time to prepare.

Another thing you could do is ask if any of the masters students teach. Depending on their skill level, that might be enough to keep you busy for a while or at least it could help you better prep for an audition."

cquglh7&AskReddit&LXA_ZO_817&"In Germany, there are three types of school that someone can go to once they hit a certain age (like 5th grade): Gymnasium, Realschule, Hauptschule. 


Gymnasium normally leads to college because they are taking college prep like coujrses and finish by taking arbitur which is like their version of ACT/SAT.  


Realschule is the next step down and these students typically find a job right after school like an apprenticeship. It is not normal for someone to go to college out of Realschule. 


Hauptschule is the lowest level and a lot of immigrants are at this level. If you go to hauptschule, you are pretty much going to be doing an apprenticeship out of school or work low paying jobs. People out of hauptschule are generally never going to college. 


When the time comes to decide who goes where, the student's teacher decides which school a child is capable of going. This decision is discussed with the parents during a meeting.

cquglho&AskReddit&tubehand&"  Thats what society has bred.   its has bred the Not-men. No one knows what it is, is it half man/ half women? is it asexual? Does it have some type of new sex hormone that we have yet to discover?

 I agree.  But then how come women want to play the roles of what use to be men, then complain about how todays men can not rationalize their own emotions and do not know what kind of work it takes to be in a relationship.  

  Because they are not men. Men arent out going to war, and working in shipyards all day any more, fighting off the corrupt unions, and trying to deal with the mafia extorting their business or wages. Doing what ever it takes to protect their family from outlaws, mafias, corrupt officials.   
The majority of Men are not dealing with emotional shamming any more. Such as, having to go to war and kill, working all fucking day, 7 days a week, just to be told  your not a man.   So no responsibility is bred.  Thus, they are not building any character.. 

   If they are not building character.. how are they going to have character in a relationship with a women?  The worst emotional shamming most men go through now is, "" I got killed in halo"", or my teacher gave me a ""c"", or that ""a girl at the bar didnt want to dance with me"". My simple point, ""men"" in the western world, are not experiencing important character building situations; that men all through out history have had to deal with.  
 But women still are dealing with the same Character building.. being objectified ect..  

Thats why more women are going to school, becoming educated, and are more mature in a relationships.  If us men, do not get are shit together.  Women are going to realize they do not need men, lock us in cages, and just use us for breeeding bahahaha.

With what the world is coming to.. 100 years from now we will be so "" progressive"" and just  be asexual beings that remove are genitals and breed through a needle and a jar"

cqugliq&unitedkingdom&chrisawhitmore&"A public service has a lot more aims than efficacy and efficiency. It has the aims of making the manager's life easy, for example, which means keeping low quality staff and not pushing for efficiency if it annoys the staff below them. It has the self interest that means that no manager will ever suggest an idea that makes them redundant and it has the crucial lack of competition which allows all of these things to go unpunished. Where a private company goes bust, a public service gets extra cash to 'rescue' it.

Look at East Coast mainline. National express paid £175m a year for the franchise plus the cost of numerous upgrade projects. They couldn't make a profit, and dropped out (to much vitriolic abuse about proftieering and so on).

A public company takes over, and pays roughly the same amount (adjusted for inflation) but without paying for upgrades, and is lauded as a huge success."

cquglis&summonerschool&ManBearScientist&"After testing Ryze, I think the rework is definitely an overall nerf and maybe a pretty heavy one.  My reasonings:

His laning phase is terrible now.  His Q can't harass over minions any more, and his low range and low damage AAs put him in range of enemy harass.  So he'll use a ton of mana CSing with Q to avoid harass while letting the enemy mostly free-farm, and he still has typical low mobility problems (needs to stay near tower).  This makes it very easy for him to get bullied.  

But worse is the fact that his late game has been heavily reduced.  Frozen Heart is much weaker without 20% CDR, and so he loses a lot of ""free"" tankiness.  And his mana ratios have uniformally been reduced by 2%.

So he scales worse on mana, meaning a lot of the midgame power of tear/ROA is reduced and he no longer builds as tanky.  So he's a low ranged, more fragile burster that now needs his passive up to burst and can actually miss.  

I don't think Ryze adds much besides damage to a team now, and I think he is weaker at every point in the game.  I was optimistic that his passive would keep him strong, but in practice I don't think it is enough.  I think he'll need to see some numbers changed in order to be viable.  "

If I want something at .33%, 2 drops it is.  I mix the same recipes multiple times, and have yet to notice a significant variation in any fo the batches.

FWIW, I determined this by dripping into a 1ml syringe until it reached .5 ml (30 drops), then repeated the process with 2 other liquids to verify that it was consistent.

- Allston being a largely transient population so its easy for people to come and go and not get recognized.
- This intersection has a long history of buskers, homeless, and gutter punks so it's conducive to that sort of ""lawless"" crowd
- Allston is less policed than many other neighborhoods
- It's halfway between the dealer and the buyers?

Been severely depressed the last week or so, I seem to just drop into it from time to time.

I think she likes me, but idk if it's worth the risk. We're supposed to go see the Avengers tomorrow, we usually go out to movies once or twice a month and at least watch a movie almost every weekend together, but I haven't heard from her since yesterday and I'm afraid she's going to cancel on me like she has before.(Sorry to be down, I just needed to get that off my chest)"

If you have never been educated to read and write in your first language a student tends to  need extra help. They also advise families to speak in their native languages in the home.

Especially last season with the producers using the episode to kick out a queen (Darienne) for free, so it's not even like an actual showdown between the top three"

cquglug&changemyview&angrystoic&"Unfortunately that just doesn't make sense. There has literally never been a law passed or repealed that wasn't supported at least implicitly by the majority. Civil rights can only improve for minorities if the majority wants them to. It's just a necessary condition for democratic society to function. How else would it work? Who gets to decide what laws should be legislated if not the majority? 

To argue your point, you have to argue that democracy is fundamentally flawed. Otherwise, we can talk about the morality of nudity and what society might look like if it was allowed, but that's a whole different thing than saying it should be legal. Sure, in a completely different set of circumstances it may be justifiable, but not in the world we live in currently.

cquglv9&skyrim&Kass1207&"My character is Kassie (may recognize my username lol). She was born in skyrim, which explains her Nordic blood, but her family moved to Hammerfell when she was too small to remember. Unfortunately, when she was a bit older, but not old enough to be on her own; her parents were killed by bandits. She swore on her life she would never kill an innocent soul, as she knew the pain that was felt by the ones left behind. Alone, scared, and too young. She stayed in Hammerfell for a few years to gather up enough gold to travel east, back to the land she was born in. She had hopes of finding distant relatives somewhere in skyrim. With her bad and unfortunate luck, she was stopped by a group of guards who accused her of murder. She was at the wrong place at the wrong time and was sent to Helgen. She believed she was destined to go back to Sovngarde to be with her long-gone parents. You can imagine the events that happened there.

Months later, after escaping Helgen and finding her true powers, she took a trip to Windhelm, having heard of its wonderous scenery, curiosity got the best of her. As she roamed the streets, she met a lonely and poorly man named Angrenor. She saw that he was struggling and offered him a gold piece. Day by day, she would give him gold. The man always offered her a story of his days as a soldier, she would listen. Mara got the best of her, and weeks later they married, residing in Lakeview Manor where they raise their two kids- Sofie and Samuel. 

Love story aside, she joined the Imperials, believing that the stormcloaks were nothing but a rebellious group. She believed in the Imperials and knew skyrim deserved better. The war still rages on outside, but she stops at nothing to protect her own family and home. She helps a person in need, keeping to her promise she made so long ago. She was born a Nord and was destined to go back to her homeland, where her destiny would be fulfilled as Dragonborn."

If you're looking for a decent ride in that pricerange, I'd recommend Bikesdirect.com. It may seem a little too good to be true, but for the price, you're not gonna find a better deal anywhere (some assembly required though, but it's not too bad). I'd take a look at [this] (http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/gravity/29point1-29er-bikes.htm) or [this] (http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/gravity/650b-27.5-bikes-g275-g1.htm) depending on what you're looking for.

I'd also encourage you to go to your local bike shop to see if they could help size you for a bike. It's useful info to have for buying online, and who knows - they might be able to cut you a deal depending on who you talk to (and where I live, my lbs also sells used bicycles at pretty insane discounts).

I imagine that this would be like us having pet dogs and teaching them to be obedient, but why go through the trouble of teaching our species to learn physics, math, and writing?

Maybe they would like to provide the best possible living arrangement for us and install some form of simulation where we can live in peace with other life forms like us because that is what makes our species the happiest. 

What if they determine that humanity is happiest when there are still discoveries and advancements to be made, thus providing hope to each and every one of our existences. This might result in them lovingly putting us in a place where we can learn and discover all the mysteries of the universe all over again, another earth perhaps.

cquglxg&WritingPrompts&Vaughen&"	“Attention passengers, Flight 231: New York to Chicago will begin boarding momentarily. Please have your tickets ready to be checked upon boarding.”
	Chad looked up. He had been preoccupied with the internet porn he was watching on his phone. He fumbled the phone into his back pocket and grabbed his bag. He got in line behind ten other people waiting to have their tickets scanned. 
	Chad was nervous. He began tapping his foot, looking from side to side while trying to seem as unsuspicious as possible. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was failing terribly.
	A minute later he was standing in front of the attendant, handing his ticket over as he tried to strike a pose that said anything other than I have a bomb in my bag. It worked; he ended up looking as if he was trying to hide an erection.
	“Sir?”
	“Sorry?” Chad replied, in a voice that sounded as if Hulk Hogan had a vice grip around his testicles.
	“Sir, you can have your ticket back,” the attendant repeated, bending forward slightly to get the ticket closer to Chad’s hand.
	“OH! Uh, thanks.” Chad took the ticket boarded the plane, shaking, but not visibly so.
Nigel watched the other passengers from the relative comfort of his seat. He was in no hurry to board; he might as well wait until everyone else has gotten on. When one’s own demise is soon at hand one tends to find an amazing new capacity for patients. 
As the last of the other passengers trickled passed the attendant Nigel got up. As he handed over his ticket the attendant asked, “What’s that ticking sound?”
“Oh, that’s just my watch, love.”
The attendant looked down at his wrist and noticed the absence of a watch, and any other time-keeping device for that matter. As she looked up at Nigel he gave her a wink and pursed his lips together to emulate a kiss. As she struggled between feelings of disgust and complete apathy towards the situation, the attendant handed back his ticket and sighed, “Have a nice flight sir. Thank you for flying Conair.”
Nigel walked down the aisle of the plane and noticed that he was sitting next to the bloke with the erection. As Nigel sat down Chad looked up and said “Hello,” but then looked embarrassed and quickly looked down to stare very intently at his shoes. Nigel sat down without comment and shoved his bag under the seat in front of him.
Flight 231 had a total of 37 minutes of uninterrupted air time before all hell broke loose. 29 minutes in Nigel went to the bathroom at the rear of the plane. Chad thought it was odd that he brought his bag to the bathroom with him, but was too nervous about what he was about to do to give it much more thought.  30 minutes in Nigel had closed the bathroom door, unzipped his bag, and pulled out the four sticks of dynamite he had hooked up to an old-fashion alarm clock. How he managed to get it past security is anyone’s guess.
At the same time Chad was reciting a mantra he had learned to overcome stage fright, or at least, Chad thought it was a mantra. Really, a list of ingredients to curry broth and a self-help mantra are pretty much the same when you don’t speak Hindi. 
32 minutes into the flight Chad pulled himself into the aisle with his bag in hand as Nigel walked out of the bathroom with his TNT held high. AT the same time both hijackers said, or rather Nigel said and Chad squealed, “Attention ladies and gentlemen! I have a bo….”
Chad turned around at the sound of an echo and noticed Nigel standing at the back of the plane. He then took notice of what Nigel was holding and promptly let out a tiny scream. 
“What!?” An elderly man in the front row asked, “What did they say?”
“I think they said they got a bong, Marty.”
“Oh, well that’s nice.” Marty quickly fell asleep and died. So, technically, Nigel and Chad were only responsible for the deaths of 87 people.
“You daft wanker, am I being punked?” Nigel shouted. “Did Clarisse put you up to this? If she did I swear to you that you’ll regret ever stepping foot on this plane.”
“N…No…?” Chad asked, for the revelation that they was now a second bomb on the plane robbed Chad of any confidence in the reality of the situation. “I….”
34 minutes into one of the flight attendants actually noticed the TNT in Nigel’s hand and began to scream. By the time minute 35 rolled along the entire cabin of the airplane was screaming. Nigel rushed at Chad and tried to grab his bag away. “Give me that bag you filthy American. The EEP will not be made a fool of by some two bit, wannabe hijacker!”
“Uh…” Chad tried to say. Unfortunately a very large, very angry looking man stood up front the back row and began to make his way towards Nigel and Chad. 
“UH!UH!” Chad grunted, darting his eyes back and forth between Nigel and the very big man. 
36 minutes into the flight Nigel found his left right should being crushed in a vice-grip very much like the vice-grip of Hulk Hogan. He was subsequently thrown backwards toward the rear cabin and landed in the aisle is a thud. As Nigel struggled to get up he noticed that the clock had fallen off the sticks of TNT. He wasn’t sure what that meant.
The very big man proceeded to grab Chad by the shoulders and lift him into the ceiling with great force. Unfortunately for everyone involved, ceilings, being solid things, don’t have very much room with which to accommodate new heads. This ceiling-head dilemma was resolved with a puncture in said ceiling and a loose of cabin-pressure.
Chad, his head, and his bomb bag were sucked out of the airplane and ended up in one of the jet-intakes. As the bomb came into contact with the jet engine it exploded and… well, I’m sure you can imagine the rest.

There are many things the bible specifically prohibits that you do not bother yourself with. One of the  most egregious examples is from the New Testament, words attributed to Jesus himself, where he speaks out against divorce. 

Most Christians have no trouble at all with divorce. But because they are massive hypocrites and because their religion has warped any sense of morality they may have possessed, they do rail against equal rights for gay people. Out of bigotry. Out of hate. They then pretend that they are not being immoral because they lyingly claim to follow the bible.

cquglyk&naturalbodybuilding&ejb30&Honestly just get whatever cheap Whey protein you can, they are all essentially the same. If your in the USA check out optimum nutrition or bodybuilding.com's own line. They're generally quite cheap. I don't personally suggest to most people to use protein powder till protein requirements become difficult to adhere to with solid food. For routines I'd suggest you check out Stronglifts 5x5 or Starting Strength. You can also handcraft your own later, but that requires you know how programming works and your own needs.

Android originally was closer to those platforms than to its current incarnation. What was on the initial Android alphas? A full load of Google services, and Google Sign-in for everything. Data was already their #1 business. To think they didn't do it for that is absurd. As much as I love Google, they're in it for collecting data.

They only OS's for smartphones were Blackberry (proprietary), Windows Mobile, and Symbian. Yes, it was kind of annoying to support both. But, the purpose of Android wasn't to unify development. The purpose was to make sure Google was the core of it.

Location audio does wireless on location all the time with battery operated receivers. Completely doable especially if you don't need a lot of channels.

cqugm2b&AskReddit&Skilol&"I always find it funny when mathematicans try to argue how ridiculous that thought is while we do have imaginary numbers, are calculating in infinite dimensions or do use the concept of n+1. 

It's not like we're not having 1/infinity or after-infinity because it's so absurd or ridiculous - The concept is not any weirder than squareroots of negative numbers. If there was a reason to have after-infinity, all we would have to do is to define it, like we defined imaginary numbers that sure as hell will never be found in our empiric world. 

We don't have after-infinity because mathematic conventions say that it doesn't exist, because we don't need it and because it's not part of the mathematical system that has evolved over the times. 

Yes, the concept of something ""after infinity"" can only ever be contemplated in a theoretical concept, but no, that's not the reason why it doesn't exist in math."

cqugm2f&49ers&garygnu&"Cornerbacks:

* 1- Kevin Johnson (Wake Forest) - - Long, fast, fluid and aggressive. His guy was always covered. 
* 2- Marcus Peters (Washington) - - Looks great on tape, the edge he uses to get in opponent's heads eventually got him kicked off the team. 
* 3- Byron Jones  (UConn) - - Great size and incredible athleticism. Always the best player on the field at Connecticut. 
 
 
Wide Receivers: 
 
* 1- Devante Parker (Louisville) - - Can take the top of a defense and go up and get jump balls on deep throws and in the red zone. 
* 2- Kevin White (West Virginia) - - A little raw, but wows with burst and looks like a new Larry Fitzgerald. (*Bears 7th*)
* 3- Amari Cooper (Alabama) - - Polished and ready for the NFL. Think new Anquan Boldin. (*Raiders 4th*)
 
  
Edge Rushers (OLB): 
 
* 1- Owamagbe Odighizuwa (UCLA) - - The only thing better than his play on the field is his name, pronounced ""o-WAH-mah-bay  o-DIGGY-zoo-wah""
* 2- Alvin ""Bud"" Dupree (Kentucky) - - Maybe a little small for the 49ers, but great burst, power and speed. 
* 3- Randy Gregory (Nebraska) - - Neck and neck with Dupree for sack potential. 
 
 
Defensive Line: 
 
* 1- Leonard Williams (USC) - - Out of reach as a top 3 pick, but a new Justin Smith. (*Jets 6th*)
* 2- Danny Shelton (Washington) - - Huge, run-stuffing nose tackle that can also rush the QB from inside. 
* 3- Henry Anderson (Stanford) - - A much, much better option at DE than other, highly touted Pac-12 linemen. 
  
 
Inside Linebacker: 
 
* 1- Stephone Anthony (Clemson) - - Great size and speed for the position. Can do almost everything Willis did.
* 2- Shaq Thompson (Washington) - - Tweener ILB/Safety size, but hard hitting and smart. Think new Kam Chancellor. "

cqugm4e&Advice&Duck464&"I'm only 17 but believe me, I've felt just like you have many a time. Honestly, the fact that nothing is meaningful when you strip it down can be the shittest thing in the world. But it's too easy to let things get you down. From my limited perspective, I feel a lot of people are naturally unhappy. If you have a choice - and most of the time you do, even if it's small - then make that effort to make the most of something. Do whatever works best for you, but it'll be your own lessons which stick most permanently. 

What's worked for me is writing something between a log and a memoir, everyday. Yep, I guess it's a diary, but you can make it more than that: a release, somewhere to count your blessings (I hate that phrase feel free to stick another here), a place to look inwards on yourself, somewhere you can evaluate your day or past few days, or record your thoughts or memories; whatever. It doesn't have to be this, but it's something which has worked for me. Not sure if this is relevant but I never set out for this to become all these things - your solutions often come indirectly. 

Don't think ahead too much. Do, of course, but if it's getting you down then cut it down a little. Don't ignore it or suppress it, but don't indulge in it either. 
What you should indulge in is what you don't know. Don't like your life? Your view of your life is so much smaller to all the possibilities it could be. Look at your boundaries and question them. And this doesn't have to be something for as extravagant as a holiday or anything like that - identify what few things bring comfort. 

Of course it's easier said than done, and I'm sorry for all the cliches (I promise they're all accidental) but you're not going to know until you know. Could you have imagined yourself as you are 2 years ago? See another 2 years on from now ... you'll be surprised. And 2 years is nothing. 

There's no point in life as we know it and that's what you should embrace. "

cqugm4x&Buttcoin&Sonereal&"No. To carry on the above example, lets assume I lend out the $90 on a five year basis, 5.36% interest. One year into the deal, I am paid. Going with 5.36% so that way the borrower is paying me back $21 a year. There's a lot of rounding going on here but here is what it looks like for the most part.



Account | Debit | Credit
---|---|----
Cash | 21 | 
Interest Revenue |  | 5
Note Receivable | | 16

The $5 in revenue isn't created, but comes from the borrower. If you're talking about the person saving their money in the bank, it works on more or less the same principle. Lets say 2% interest a year on deposits.

Account | Debit | Credit
---|---|----
Deposit | 2 | 
Interest Revenue |  | 2

There's no currency being created here, but there is credit created. The bank doesn't ""literally"" create currency anywhere in the process.

First game (one of the only games, come to think of it) that ever made me bawl like a baby.  The story is amazing, the characters are loveable and unique, the villain is pure evil, and the sprites themselves tend to be pretty cute with expressions and whatnot.

edit: Oh, how could I forget - if you wanna get kinda weird, check out Earthbound (also SNES; I'm old).  That game is like one long fever dream, but it's absolutely dripping with memorable charm."

I'm not bashing sororities or anything, I think they're fine if that's your thing, but to me it's just bizarre and a little hard to believe that two people who were strangers can really love each other that quickly. I'm not saying go psycho-obsessive, but I always wondered what happens if the designated big and littles just don't click. Do they get different ones?

I managed to tense up during a showing of Alien even though I'd seen it a hundred times at home.

It's just unfortunate that the moviegoing masses have no sense of decorum any more, and that the lack of awareness (or lack of giving a shit about anybody else) translates across all age groups. I've had a row of seniors who wouldn't shut up, i've had teenagers fucking around on their phones and people in their 30s trying to pick fights because someone didn't sit down fast enough *before* the lights had even gone down for the previews.

But the reality is that I am probably not able to play enough to develop, master and win tournaments with a particularly unique list. So I should consider embracing the archetypes with demonstrated effectiveness.

Just that I need to mentally prepare myself for this moment through the practice (which can be seen as compassionate towards others since the practice benefits everyone). 

I think for me, personally, I did not feel great compassion for others because I know that I will never experience others around my crying or being sorrowful or upset. 

The reason for this is because it is an illusion/delusion, my mind creates these people. I don't know what they will *really* experience plus it won't ever exist for me anyways. "

The `this` in jQuery event handlers is a regular element. If you want to turn it into a jQuery thingy, you just have to pass it to the `$` function.

So, if it's a regular element, `$(element)` will do the trick.

I highly recommend to learn how to use the dev tools. In the debugger, you can easily inspect elements. There are videos on YouTube which explain how to use it. Just search for ""chrome dev tools"" (or ""firebug"") and you should find some."

cqugm9o&leafs&brokenshoelaces&"Okay time for a thought experiment.  Would you trade #2 and #9 overall picks for a 22 year old Kessel over again?  Most of us wouldn't I don't think.

Now, would you trade #2 and #9 overall for a Kessel who is now **28** years old if we had been able to throw in Komisarek as a salary dump?  Because your proposal has Carolina doing almost exactly that.  (Fleury was picked #7, and the #5 this year is considered equivalent to #2 in 2010.)

I still find it impossible to imagine they would bite on that.  That's almost the same deal Burke did, but for a player who's 6 years older, does the Semin cap dump really make up that much value?

Also here's something I find funny: early this season before the tank began there was lots of speculation (in the media, and also here) that the Leafs might look to trade Kadri and/or Gardiner for E. Staal because Carolina would be looking to rebuild.  But now we're thinking they will do the exact opposite and trade their two best prospects for a 28 year old.

Francis said they might be willing to drop down a bit, but that's not the same as saying they'd be willing to get older.  Most likely it's because there's a large group of prospects in the 4-10 who scouts see as very close, so they would consider dropping down to say #8 and get an extra pick out of it."

If you want chromas, you will buy them. It's not a ploy for cheap money, the cost of developing the skin has nothing to do with its final price, the price is set at a level where it matches the value it has to the player, because their business model has buying as a choice (and they want it to be a choice that feels appropriate to the content's perceived value).

cqugmc2&worldnews&GeminiCroquette&"I remember reading a short story about some rouge jupiter-sized planet that swung through our solar system and knocked earth off its orbit and out into deep space.  Within a few months, it got so cold that the atmosphere literally froze all around the earth, down to a 10 foot deep liquid oxygen/frozen nitrogen snow.  The few people that remained survived by heating pockets of these gases and creating breathable areas enclosed in strong tarps/balloons.

I know people freak out about ""the end of the world"" but short of something catastrophic like being ejected from the solar system or being nailed by an unstoppable comet, the human race will have a hard time dying off completely.  Sure, all out nuclear war can kill BILLIONS but there will always be survivors."

cqugmfy&news&Binxly&"For the sake of making sure people don't feel the need to walk on eggshells.  For example, I am a white woman.  If I'm called 'white,' the color of my skin, most, myself included, aren't offended.  However, some white, black, asian, etc persons ARE super sensitive and wait in the grass like a snake to decry offense over even the most minute and unintentional verbal mis-step such as calling a white person 'white' or an black person 'black.'

I read a lot of articles, since the special made me do a 180 on my view of Jenner, but he mentions that he is not so easy to offend, but he knows he isn't the example of the 'community' of trans people and didn't want people to be offended when they called Jenner a 'he' for the time being, especially in the interview.

I'm rather certain he'd *prefer* 'she' or 'her' but, knowing the media is still puzzled over pronouns and the whole gender issue, Jenner was aware many would still call her a 'he' or 'him' and, knowing that did not affect their own self identity, she was cognizant enough to know many in the community seem to be far less stable and could be set off even if it was a comment against Jenner that they took vicariously as an attack on them via Jenner.

It all sounds super crazy insane, but honestly, think about it, all of us are spoiled.  Its like she said, we wake up and go on with life, the majority of us, with little to no discord over whom we are or the person in the mirror.  Its unavoidable that Jenner lived 65 years in the physical body of a male and same goes for many trans people so, when a trans person I used to talk to at the clinic I worked at began to explain the issues surrounding pronouns, I at first felt they were being a brat, but, put into context, its like a white person saying racism is over.

You aren't dealing with their lot of life and all that comes with it.  So to pass judgement on their wishes to be called as they identify when we have no perspective ourselves is kinda out of line.  When it was put into such a context, i realized how unfair I was being and actually gained from those conversations.  I applaud Jenner, however, for doing that so the media did not receive blowback for any pronouns they very well may not have meant to be derogatory or negative."

cqugmgj&nba&angrycrayon9&"the opponent can't force you to do anything. If they sag off you or take off the right side, you still have the decision of whether or not to shoot it/ go left. 

The difference is that when you intentionally foul at the end of the game, you can only foul the player with the ball. The offensive team has the ability to control who shoots the free throws, and therefore can control their own destiny.
When you hack-a-player, you remove any control that an offensive team has whatsoever. You punish them for even daring to play a bad FT shooter, even if that player is only in there for defense.

It was certainly the lesser of the two objections but it was still a good one. 

And of course, the capital ships problem was recently taken care of :)

That is the scuttlebutt on the New York radio messageboards. I saw them after Erock's Meatballs interview got linked at one. 

WPLJ does something called the ""Summer BlastOff!"" where they do a bunch of events to get listeners and retain what they got. That is typically when people get the axe there, May and June, and they try to get people hyped for a new show at that time.  

Everybody thinks Jayde is gunning for Todd and could co-host with somebody already on the show, Annie, who is basically Jayde's more masculine Sam Roberts. 

The only question is if Todd gets shit-canned and bought out this summer or NEXT summer. Everybody over there thinks Todd is getting the boot and deserves it. They were Scott and Todd fans, not Opie and for a lot of those people, Todd is their Opie. They're pissed that Todd threw out the talent of the duo, Scott Shannon, and are thrilled that Todd is bombing and Scott Shannon is on a top 5 talk show on WCBS. As they should be.

Just like in the Australian team, I assumed Will Chambers was indigenous when he could easily have been an islander. 

In this instance whether you look 'white' is a relatively accurate distinction between the non-indigenous players and indigenous players in the Australian and New Zealand test squad.

cqugmk6&ContestOfChampions&Beardo09&This might sound counter intuitive but if I could go back one thing I'd do differently is level up the not so great champs first.  Your bolt and iron man at 3/1 (with masteries) may not be *great* but they should be able to win matches consistent after the 10th.  At that point as long as you're keeping the streak going the 3rd match is of a bit less consequence; I think that's where the great champs shine, because you could probably leave your 2* Hawkeye at a low r2 and he'll still be able to pull out wins consistently - but with better scores due to his lower lvl.

cqugmlx&Games&Discoteca&"It isn't even the quality of mods that is a concern for me, but how much more difficult it is to properly troubleshoot what mods are causing CTDs compared to mod organizer on Steamworks. 

It is a lot easier to handle what mods overwrite each other without having to reinstall them in a specific order and deactivate them without risk of leaving remnants of it in the game directory.

Even simple texture mods that shouldn't be an issue can be buggy and crash the game, or mess up saves to the point where even removing them isn't going to reverse it's effects. 

I just have a lot of skepticism about the ability to ensure a headache free experience that people would expect of paid mods. Even mods made with the official game and DLCs in mind can have issues, so the only way a mod might become stable enough across all systems regardless of what mod list they have would be for them to be universally used to the point where they are considered official DLC.

I've spent hours trying to narrow down what specific actions and then what mods were causing CTDs. Something I'm more than willing to endure for free content, but certainly not for paid. Once something is put behind a paywall it's seen as less of an experimentation. I'd hesitate to even really call them mods at that point, and just call them DLCs so I'd expect them to work seamlessly with other third party developed DLCs just as I don't expect official DLCs to break one another."

THE LEFT: an unarmed teen had racist police snap his spine and let him die. So people are protesting this innocent man. Poverty and racism are to blame. 

THE RIGHT: a black criminal ran from the police and had an injury some time during the arrest. He also had a prior spinal injury and was trying to hurt himself inside the police vehicle. So rioters are using this as an excuse to rob stores and destroy things. Lack of family structure and liberal policies are to blame.

THE CENTER: someone died in police custody. Certain people are upset and a protest then turned riot occured. Millions in damage. 7 cops in the hospital. Hundreds of arrests. Nothing is accomplished.

Anyone that knows them could buy something as a gift (more likely with luxury products, like handmade accessories). And not everyone prefers the music of their youth. You're probably right that a lot of people won't notice the reference, but most people don't have bad associations with the song either, so its just a cute phrase. No harm done.

cqugmo4&h1z1&Onatac&"My issue has absolutely nothing to do with KOS. If I see someone with a backpack, weapon, and/or helmet equipped... I'm going to shoot at them. I'm a rabid PvPer who prefers open-PvP and full player looting. KOS doesn't bother me one bit.

My issue stems from this:

*John Smedley ✔@j_smedley*

*we're toning down guns and ammo you find btw. way too much out there.*

*1:44 PM - 2 Feb 2015*

*John Smedley ✔@j_smedley*

*we want it to be a survival game not a gun show.*

*1:45 PM - 2 Feb 2015*

 H1Z1 is still a gun and ammo show. Many players burn weapons into metal bars because there are so many. Personally, I don't even pick up any weapons from loot spots, anymore. They've become so common that passivity is the norm with regard to looting them. Ammo is everywhere. If anyone states otherwise, they aren't being honest. Figure out 3-4 loot routes, loop one or two, then bank. Go back out and hit the other loops. Rinse. Repeat. Ammo, ammo, and more ammo. 

Whether Jimmy likes it or not, he's one of the main faces of H1Z1, and since he's the combat guy, the criticism about anything related to it will be directed at him. I'd find it very, very hard to believe that he has zero input on the the loot frequency part of *his* work. It's clearly his preference. CS, eSports, BR... That's him. It's fine and all, but it also makes me worry about the sandbox nature of this game and if it will ever be realized. Sandboxes are not only about giving, giving, and giving. It's about ebs and flows, winning, losing, finding, not being able to find, et cetera. We don't have much of that in terms of depth. It's simply live, die, then easily more of everything. That's it.

I love guns in games. I love PvP (I'm still waiting for a no-zombie server). On the other hand, I was under the impression this game would be a little different than others when talking about being armed to the teeth pretty much at all times. The more Jimmy puts in, the more the vocals will be screaming for ""more, more, MORE!"". And with that, will come frequency. It can have a trickle down effect to other systems, too, since there isn't any scarcity. One being the player economy they want to have happen. That is a general loot system problem, though (dumb minimum loot quota they have); not just a gun and ammo one."

is the police force in baltimore a little corrupt? absolutely. are people profiled and arrested on a daily basis? once again, yes and its a pattern that needs to end if we can hope to fix poverty.

but i think these riots are only happening now because its coming after a mound of similar cases popping up in the news. and people saw ferguson as a very eye opening moment and are choosing to act similarly. the difference is baltimore is not a small, somewhat removed community. its a very large, very diverse city and a lot more people stand to get hurt or have their property destroyed.

cqugmsa&SaltLakeCity&Dsch1ngh1s_Khan&"I went to a charter school during high school, I still consider it one of the best decisions I made. We had an excellent community also, everyone pretty much knew everyone somehow. Everyone (assuming the school specializes in something) has *atleast* 1 similar interest. ""Bullies"" or ""Jocks"" just didn't exist. 

Lots of people like to compare test statistics to show why charter schools are no better or worse than other public schools, but that means shit when your school specializes in something that isn't going to be on a standardized test anyways. 

It means something when the child doesn't hate going to school, can seriously focus on a subject that very much interests them, actually have a say in how the school functions, have small class sizes, and doesn't feel left out while also getting the standard curriculum required.

**Tl;Dr** - I think most charter schools are like this, it's just the culture that comes with most.

Every time the clicking sound went away for a while but always came back after 50-100km. It was driving me nuts during climb. My LBS worked on it at least 3-4 times as well. There was no correlation whatsoever with riding in the rain or dirt. I  finally solved the issue by switching the crank from the original S-500(I think) to to a force 22. So far, it's been about 1000km without that awful sound. Apart from that, it's a great bike!

I am ultra consistent on pistol rounds, always a double or triple kill, sometimes a quad. Gun rounds I am far less consistent - this is because all the other players limit themselves by addadada spam on pistol rounds fucking with their accuracy, but they don't on gun rounds.

cqugmvf&television&DankrudeSandstorm&Never thought I'd hear that in my life, but you're entitled to your opinion. While Larry isn't awful, since I've been watching most of his episodes, I feel as if his jokes are not as funny and his personality is bland. The satire Colbert used was more intelligent and his personality was far better. I find LWT to be very hit or miss. What I do like is that he tries to have both sides represented, but sometimes fails at it. For example he had an all black panel and every one of them agreed with the riots in Baltimore and one even said the mom shouldn't have disciplined her child. Then there was the episode with some anti vaxing old lady and while she blabbed about some statistics about autism no one even refuted her ideas, with the exception of another guest calling her dumb.

Stirring the pot, as it were.

I find that callous and juvenile.

I enjoy reality videos of fights, freak outs, and whatever other drama as much as the next person.

However to take such delight in a circus of physical and emotional pain purely for your unempathetic voyeuristic pleasure just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

It's one thing to watch a Russian dash cam of simple reality unfolding, but to actively encourage a drunk woman to get rowdy in the hopes that she embarrases herself or the person she is raging against...just seems in poor taste.

Yeah I'm a bit drunk, but the point is when I hear a guy frantically screaming worldstar while people are going through a potential trauma turns me off.

cqugn1m&CompetitiveHS&gecko_tank&"Honestly a lot of these dragon decks are just worse versions of decks that are already popular. Dragon paladin has potential because of consort and it's decent ability to heal/stall but the rest are just mediocre from my experience.

I tried to make a dragon handlock but it was just pointless, the deck is awesome as is and subbing out the mid/lategame stuff for dragons doesn't synchronize with the rest of the deck at all. Dragon warrior is the same way, its just a noticeably worse wallet warrior.

I think the big stuff for this expansion isn't going to be the dragons, it is going to the stuff that makes existing decks better. Thaurissan, quick shot, and solemn vigil come to mind. I think the biggest thing to come out of BRM is grim patron, he is the only card that actually spawned a completely new deck.

Edit: since a lot of people are replying with their success stories I'll phrase things this way. I think the current dragon decks are unrefined knockoffs of already popular decks. I think with some time people will find out what works and what doesn't and maybe go from there. Just from today's play testing alone I've started to reconsider how good I think drakonid crusher is for example. "

cqugn2c&AskReddit&PM_ME_YOUR_KHAJIIT&"between the ages of 7 and 14, I had almost nightly nightmares regarding kidnapping, murder, and rape, because my father let me watch shit like law and order svu as a child. The worst one were when I'd be held down and I'd have to listen to the sounds of my friends, my very young sister, or my mother being beaten and raped. I still get flighty when I hear certain people screaming because of that connection. 

Nowadays, I have recurring dreams about some really stressful topics. One that rolls around every month or so is both my parents dying and having to fight my abusive grandmother for custody of my sister in court. Things that involve death in the family happen infrequently. between 13-15ish, lots of dreams where I'm forced to turn tricks, or someone I know is, and those were horrible.

I'd recommend maxing out Smelters and Mines whenever you have the resources to spare, that should keep you supplied with plenty of coal.  The hit you take to wood and minerals from the Smelters will cease to be relevant eventually.  Smelters also produce Iron and Gold, which you'll always need, and eventually you can upgrade them to make Titanium, which will MASSIVELY boost your production of that if you've got a good supply of Smelters to start with.  

Once you unlock Geologists, they're very useful to have, especially when upgraded.  

If your coal production starts to exceed iron production, it'll be hard to make much steel, so that's when you should probably back off on the coal or build more Calciners.  "

cqugn5y&mildlyinteresting&troglodave&"It's actually something I'm kind of proud of, to be honest. I work for a large GC in a pretty large market (DC, NOVA, Baltimore) and compliance is something that is important to us. We not only develop and build our own projects, but we do the same for third party clients, as well as renovating and remodeling existing buildings. Depending on how the project is designed and financed, we comply with FHA, ADA and the hardcore standard of the bunch, [UFAS](http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-aba-standards/ufas). After completion, every project we complete is inspected by the [EOC] (http://eoc.govmu.org/English/Pages/default.aspx) and certified as compliant. 

I really hope I'm not coming off as a know-it-all prick, but getting all this stuff right the first time is a BFD, and kind of a fun challenge for me.  "

cqugn7u&canucks&steeze3PO&"As a kid I loved the Orca, but once I found out WHY it became the orca it left a bitter taste in my mouth I haven't been able to get out. Honestly I don't like any of the Canucks logos whether its the V, the skate, the orca, or that ridiculously cartoonish Johnny Canuck. I find it hard to believe they can't hire some graphic designer to come up with something a little better. 

I really like the color scheme, it screams Vancouver, and think it fits the team better than any logo we've had ever did. The current/recent Canucks are typically not the style of team that could pull off the strong black/yellow jerseys of the early 90's imo. No idea WHAT would be better, thats for someone a lot more creative than me to decide, but man have we had a bad case of identity-crisis since our induction into the NHL. Sad. 

Just for reference, my personal favorite Logos/jerseys in the NHL are the Blackhawks (Best overall Jersey imo) Sabers (the one with the actual sabers, not the buffalo head) Montreal (not a HUGE fan of the toilet bowl but the overall jersey is unreal) St. Louis, Detroit, Toronto, Winnipeg (new one, not the old one), Philly, and Ottawa back before they changed to the 3D dude. And of course the Hartford Whalers. "

Then at NE ruins his hip and career pretty much ended there since he was so stiff.

As for Chad Jackson I'd defend that pick.  The guy had really good hands and was good at getting open and had solid routes.  most saw him as a fringe first and he apparently interviewed well w/ belichick(but it was controversial overruling by Bill apparently). Hard to predict your WR would develop a hamstring issue in TC as a rookie and struggle to play through it after missing most of camp then tearing his ACL missing 07 camp.  Everything went wrong health wise for the guy and if you looked in 08 when he finally had a healthy training camp he lost so much athleticism."

I mean my tats arent really ""generic,"" but when I was 17 someone bet me I wouldnt have the balls to get a bic lighter tattooed across my heart, so of course I did it to win the bet. I'm 28 now and I really don't regret it. I only have 1 other tattoo on the center of my back that I somewhat regret; a biohazard symbol comprised of the earth in the center with various elements making up the 6 outer curves of the symbol. (i.e. one is an ice cliff opposite a curling wave of water, ones a potleaf opposite a curl of flames, etc). Also done when I was young, I went the cheap route (drew it myself, paid 350) but the tatto artist's rendition of it is mediocre at best (shoulda spent closer to 1k IMO, considering its complexity) but I hope to one day cover it up with the same design, slightly larger and with a much better execution. Besides, tattoo removal is fairly efficient these days, albeit expensive."

D/D Ele has that hybrid cross where you can ""tank"" while doing effective damage once your ""procs"", in this case Might stacking, goes into play. You have ""bleeds"" in the form of... well, Bleeding and Burning. D/D Ele can stick both of those fairly reliably. 

Anything I say in quotes means that the term doesn't technically exist in GW2. I'd say the closest to Feral is still D/D Ele.

No stealth though, unlike Feral. But you have a number of blast finishers so you can use one of those in an Engineer or Thief's smoke field and gain stealth from it.

Edit: As far as the combo points mechanic goes, that'd be Warrior. I wouldn't say Warrior is close to Feral though. "

cqugneb&brasil&gdrmatos&"No dia que as pessoas pararem de viver no ""lindo mundo da imaginação"", irão ver que por trás da dureza desse texto da Veja existem alguns pontos muito válidos. Enquanto os indicadores de educação não melhorarem, não tem governo de Luciana Genro que aumente realmente os salários dos professores. É um problema muito mais cultural do que de alocação de recursos. 

Quando comecei a estudar Química muita gente olhava horrizada para mim, uma vez que meu irmão gêmeo passou para Medicina e nós dois sempre tivemos desempenhos escolares muito similares e tiramos escores muito próximos no vestibular. Não conseguiam entender porque eu faria um curso para ""virar professor"" quando podia fazer medicina. De fato, eu mesmo não quero ser professor de Ensino Médio, quero fazer pesquisa e dar aulas em Ensino Superior, mas esse comportamento dos meus familiares e dos conhecidos apenas mostra como a própria cultura do brasileiro coloca o docente em uma categoria inferior. É um ciclo vicioso no sistema atual: a educação é ruim, o aluno mal-formado acha que é o sistema é bom o suficiente, os professores continuam a ganhar mal, os sindicatos promovem greves e, se ganham algo, conseguem aumentos pífios, a educação continua ruim e por aí vai.

Agora, quando tenta-se quebrar esse ciclo, arejar as escolas com idéias novas os primeiros a rejeitar são os próprios sindicatos! Não tem cabimento isso! Não se leva metodologias novas pq os professores são mal-pagos; os diretores de escola não podem ter cursos de formação em administração e economia escolar porque ""educação não pode ser monetarizada""; os alunos são violentos e cometem graves ameaças, mas não pode denunciá-los a secretaria de educação (ou polícia em casos extremos) porque isso traumatiza, etc. É um sistema falido!

I am from a very diverse place. The highest ethnicity is only 31% of the population. I grew up with a wide variety of cultures, which I base my opinions on. I also lived in a white upper middle class suburb in Arizona for three years, as well as a poor immigrant neighborhood in Boston for three years.

From what I have seen of black culture in America, the girls often go to college, the boys go to prison. Black boys are expected to act a certain way, or they are treated as almost traitors to their race. 

It bugs more way more than it should every time I hear someone say ""Oh, he's not really black"" or something similar.

One of my friends is from Angola, and he pointed out to me that the black people he met while living in San Francisco were always ghetto and uneducated, whereas the black population in Boston was much more diverse, probably due to the high number of immigrants from Haiti, Africa, etc. 

My best friend also said much of the same after moving to North Carolina. 

It seems to me that too many urban black kids have to deal with their poverty along with a ghetto culture that promotes being uneducated. 

If you want an example of what I'm talking about, as silly as it seems, watch this [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeaBYEzsZfg)

A lot of black kids deal with this.

Poor whites, rednecks in particular, also deal with this. In this regard, Asian culture is much superior (although it has its own problems.)"

I've recently read about European Union regulators laying down groundwork for antitrust charges against google. They claim google acted abusively in terms of attempting monopolization of the market. Similar to the 1999 case against microsoft case, they are being compared. Microsoft was found guilty and forced to change their ways paving the way for Google to take over the market. Criteria used was lack of technological change in the foreseeable future and lack of substitutes. Airlines are in fact part of a rapidly changing market, they are changing as fast as search engines change, even on a quarterly basis.

Any career that's lucrative will always be more than 50-60 hours a week.. 

Successful people don't get there with 40 hours a week.

You can drink any beer you want, as long as you drink it on moderation. Moderation for someone who is used to just drinking whenever they want is likely to feel like not drinking at all.

I love craft beer. I also love having visible abs. So I drink great craft beer maybe twice per month and only a couple bottles at any one time.

cqugnlg&news&iamgodshand&"Honestly, I think you need to take some time and reevaluate your statement. Have you ever worked a high-level management position? I can tell you from everyone I've spoken with (even the people who claim to need less sleep) that it takes a toll on you. Now, while some people certainly thrive in such positions, these are public companies. You don't get to just dick around and get paid for it. Don't get me wrong, you might for a month of two, but you'll get fired so fast. 

People in top-level positions are generally knowledge workers. This means that they're not paid to do a thousand little things, but rather to make sure that the big things get done right. It also means managing other people.

What g_gggg said is 100% on point. If you're making six figures, you're getting paid to run a division without going to someone higher up every 5 minutes to ask for help. You're expected to produce results. If you're making 5 figures, you tend to get more oversight. That doesn't mean you don't work as hard, but often it means that you're doing a different type of work.

That being said, sure, there is a level of arbitrariness in many of these CEOs, but at the same time, they are all working their asses off to grow their companies. If you really have 'nofeels' and 'justdebate', try and look at the situation as critically as possible. Choose a CEO and try and learn about them and what they do. You'll quickly see that there is a lot more going on than meets the eye."

cqugnql&explainlikeimfive&kruelkids&"No it is not about equality, not when we've been turning a blind eye towards a system has been pushing down blacks. Yes there are other races who suffer police brutality, but there are so many statistics that show police, enforcers of the law, single out blacks more than any other race. 
The police arrest and imprison blacks without parole far more often than whites for similar non-violent cases. There are such high arrests in impoverished areas like Ferguson because the community needs cash and no big businesses are going to be willing to open up and pay taxes in poor areas. Police officers have gone on record saying that they aren't racist, but at night when they are patrolling and see a black man in a bad area that they are scared for their lives.  
People are rioting and peacefully protesting to address a system that is obviously broken. 
For so many of you jumping to say that we should strive for equality is ludicrous. These same people have yet to even accept that there is a massive race issue in America. Exclusive and specific chants like ""Black lives matter"" are addressing the inequalities. America forced a group of people from their country and enslaved them. We destroyed their identity and any connections to their history. And as they try to rebuild a new culture we mock their innovative names and hairstyles. We compare them to un-evolved monkeys every chance we get including now when they riot to open our eyes about the conditions we are closed off from because we have the privilege to type behind our keyboards and watch on tv as they bring fire to Baltimore. We built our country on their backs and refuse to include them in our narrative. So yes - it is about recognizing a struggle.

If she hits the gym to burn 200-300 calories and then just eat 600 more at home (at least for a meal), then she's not going to lose weight. She's just trying to get positive attention for getting up and going to the gym when she's not making any better life choices, you know?"

You **can** pay to get 97 herblore, you can buy TH keys like crazy to get EXP lamps and get it wholly from just playing TH. 

You can also buy bonds to fund herblore, which is also P2W. 

That said, you can also *not* pay to win and achieve the same ends, you can achieve 97 herblore without paying Jagex any money. In the event that you *do* pay them money for an advantage, say by getting a ton of XP lamps from TH or buying bonds to have the money to train herblore, you've paid to win.

If instead of this you've worked hard, grinding out in game gold and then trained herblore and never once even thought or buying bonds, th keys, whatever else, 97 herblore is not pay to win.

I'm literally saying ""if you pay to win, you're paying to win. If you don't pay to win, you're not paying to win.""

Talk to the financial aid office (do it before you commit, as you have more leverage!). I've never heard of someone graduating with more than $30k for four years. You should be able to get a significant amount of your tuition lowered, up to $5k work study a year, access to interest free loans, and even grants. 

Cornell is a great school and you will have incredible opportunities here. But no one should graduate undergrad that much in debt. And I doubt you'd have to. Call the financial aid office tomorrow! There is absolutely no way they'd let you graduate with that much debt and will work with you to find a far more reasonable plan."

cqugns8&leagueoflegends&ManedWolf08&"I will just paste my comment above here since it seems like you haven't seen it. I think it's a pretty good response to what you said and why I think it's wrong and this move is a risky one.

I have no doubt that Rekkless is a way better player than Steelback will ever be and I know that Steelback is just a role player and he will never be a star.

However, that's the whole point about ruining Fnatic's team Dynamic. Yellowstar plays a heavy roaming style right now, because leaving Steelback and roaming around to help Febiven, setting up vision and even going top for ganks is not an issue. Steelback is not the main carry of the team so if he loses some farm in the process it is no problem.

Fnatic right now is also a Top and mid focused team. Huni and Febiven do most of the heavy lifting and they are the members who get more attention from Reignover.

Lastly, Fnatic loves to fight. They play a risky fighting style where at any point in the game they might start forcing team fights or skirmishes all around the map.

Now going back to Rekkless, he will demand more farm, he is so passive early game and does not want to come for fights and he wants jungler attention. I don't wanna make this already long comment any longer so I guess these points can help you understand why getting Rekkless is not really the smartest idea and why it might ruin their team dynamic."

I'm just an insect trying to get out of the night

I only stick with you because there are no others

You are all I need""



To me, this is a perfect summary of what it feels like obsessing over someone who doesn't reciprocate your feelings. And god....

Ultimately Duncan changed his diet to something healthier, like lean meats and vegetables. He started eating something almost like a cave man diet. Also, he started swimming and boxing in the summer during the off season. Not only did this result in weight loss, which makes it easier on his joints when he runs, it also increased his cardio and overall endurance.

cqugnyz&electronic_cigarette&morbidangel27&I recently read something about nicotine. Never smokers who were exposed to pure nicotine (not cigs) showed no signs of dependency. I forget where i read that, it was a vape site but it linked to the study. There are very little studies done on the subject. Tobacco smokers become heavily addicted to nicotine for life though, thanks to the help of the nicotine delivery system in cigs that make it much more addictive than it actually is.
cqugnz0&BDSMcommunity&throwawayLouisa&"OK - I'm going to be 'that guy' and take some stick here. I'm going to cover myself in caveats in this paragraph, but there are going to be a lot of people disliking what I say in the second. Yes - the 'kink community' (IRL, on FetLife, and of course, here on Reddit) needs to support, and train, people in how to recognise and avoid abuse. Yes the community needs to recommend safety measures to take with new partners. Yes, the community needs to actively exclude anyone known to be abusive, including, obviously, those who ignore Safewords.  

But but but. We can't try to create a parallel system to our nations' legal systems. There's the impression given by the linked article that 'the community' needs to somehow invent ways to identify and prosecute 'creeps'. Well we can't. We can't invent kangaroo courts based on hearsay and rumour. The legal system exists for a purpose. It's been honed. It's been proven by trial and error. It's imperfect, but it does work, on the basis of a random selection of our peers judging all evidence, and finding it to be beyond reasonable doubt.  

The linked Salon article describes Maggie Mayhem telling an audience about her rape. If the experience was as described, then it was clearly, legally, rape. Take the kink out of this and what is still left? Assault. Rape. But the key thing missing from the description is whether the police and courts were involved. This story is nothing to do with kink as such. I hope, without knowing more of this story, that Maggie, and the court system, prosecuted this man, and that he was found guilty, and punished for his crime.

What we *can* do is train people in how to negotiate relationships. How to express consent and how to withdraw it. How to find partners they can trust. How to be safe on a first date.   
After all, meeting someone for the first time for kinky bondage play, is a very, very vulnerable high risk version of a normal first date, (and we would tell our daughters all sorts of safety advice if they were going on a non-kinky first date - or even, traditionally, open the door to the new boyfriend while casually holding the shotgun)

The kink community is *soooo* sex-positive (which is, nominally, lovely) that sometimes new subs seem to forget all the common-sense safety rules their parents taught them at their knee as children:  
1. Don't trust someone you've just met   
2. Don't go home alone with them before you know them better  
3. Don't go alone with someone who real name you don't even know!  
4. Tell someone where you're going  
5. Meet in public places first  
6. Don't go home with someone until you've seen how they interact with others, with their friends, with waiting-staff

This old-fashioned stuff somehow seems to get forgotten in the NRE excitement, when new subs are contacted online by potential abusers posing as experienced Doms.  Maybe I'm just too old, because I remember life before the World Wide Web, and maybe the next generation born won't have come across the 1993 cliche that [""On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)"

But if you actually think about it, it's not worth the money, and people that do not play this game have all agreed. They laugh at the quality of the recolors and the price.

But because you guys enjoy this game so much, you'd buy anything really.

When normal people with no skill in photoshop create a chroma pack with even more colors, and the same if not higher quality, then that's a problem. And any person who isn't biased would agree.

If I make a drawing which is garbage, but people buy it, doesn't mean that's the worth of it. Because I bet you if the price would have been lower, more people would buy it.

Maybe these pictures could even help stop the vandal that was ruining my life and wrecking my home. For months now, any time my wife would head out for another late shift he must have seen the car leaving the house.  Out at 6 in the evening, never to return before 5 am.  The bastard probably thought she was the only one that lives here.  I don't drive after the accident so I guess it's not obvious I'm even home.  My office is in the back and when she's gone I don't do much anyway.
Last night changed everything.  I got him dead to rights, I have photo proof and I can't wait for Katherine to get home.  I've sat up since 3 this morning going over the pictures making sure I've got him from every angle.  I fell asleep in my chair and he paid me no mind as I silently awoke to every picture on the mantle being thrown to the floor and shattered.  What kind of asshole comes in to a house just to tear it down?  It doesn't matter, I'll show her the evidence and we can put these past few months behind us, maybe get a better security system or move out of here altogether.  I think she'll be relieved just to know the truth.
I hear the garage door opening and I get my phone back out and open my gallery, readying my triumph.  As she unlocks the door to the garage I scan the pictures one last time.  Nothing but broken bottles and our Schnauzer Frankie pressed up against the wall with his tail between his legs, terrified.  In the last photo it appears that camera has been turned around and, unaware, there I am on screen with a thousand yard stare, lips moistened with brandy and a dead look in my eyes.  A competition of embarrassment and disappointment wash over me as I quietly put my phone away, preparing a bewildered apology for the state of the house.

The major riots and protests were a coincidence as the initial plans began to take form as buildings later in the decade. Here is [an article](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2013/10/18/campus_brutalism_were_the_buildings_designed_to_thwart_student_riots.html) debunking the myth. 

Also, a subreddit /r/brutalism if you want to see more."
cqugo2r&XcutionRP&GrandDream&"*The city shone as Renetta looked out over the City of Light.  The river of dotted lights glowing as they traveled down stream of L'Avenue des Champs Elysées towards destinations unknown.  The lights moved passed a magnificent spires of metal, erected into the inky black night sky as tribute to the liberation of worthless people; they moved under a glorious arc designed in tribute to battles long ago won by the dead; the lights continued in a constant stream, without beginning, or end, as Renetta stared out into them—pondering how the world has been filled with so many lights which serve only to stare in awe at their grater’s accomplishments of the past.*  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                     
With a silent sigh, her eyes shift focus as they caught her own reflection in the glass of her ceiling to floor windows in her luxury apartment.  Her eyes were beautiful, but full of melancholy and mourning—in her recent trip to New York she had only found a handful of beings of note, and fewer Quincy who would wish to follow her.  She bore down destruction upon the city of New York, attacking it with wave upon wave of destruction from untamed Hollow...but there were so few of consequence who would to fight in challenge of this, so few who stood up for anything, so few who were interesting enough to bother giving a second look—most just died, and there is nothing interesting about the dead.
                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                              
*Renetta looked deep into her milk-chocolate coloured eyes, appreciating how beautiful they were before changing them to a strawberry-pink.  Enamored in her own reflection, in it's perfection was staring back into her eyes so lovingly, as if it was the only thing who would ever truly understand her, the only one who loved her as much as she did.*
                                                                                                                                                     
*During her induction and training under The Shadow, throughout the mind numbing, torturous pain she endured, there was only ever one who watched over her throughout it all.  The instructors looked upon her as they demanded more and more, the other 'students' looked to her as example, but it was only ever her Reflection which was always present in her life.  Her Reflection was the only one who's eyes were always upon her, and the only one who could match her every perfect movement or motion.*
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Renetta stood up from her windowed perch overlooking the streams of headlights racing around the city, the beauty of the city and it's many wonders had been lost on her for a number of hours—as she was entranced with her own reflection, staring into it as it stared back into her.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           *As her towering grandfather clock rung out the hour, on the hour, every hour, she found herself unable to escape her Reflection's gaze.  She was lost, lost in her Reflection—unsure if she was helpless to look away, or if she just did not want to...or both; at any rate it no longer mattered to her, this was the most content she had been in a long time.*                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                     
She could see her Reflection smile slightly, smile at her—amused at just how enamored and engrossed she was become.  Her Reflection reached up and pressed her hand against the glass, as though she wanted through, into Renetta's extortionately luxurious (bordering on gaudy) apartment in the City of Light.                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Renetta had also pressed her hand against the glossy window, it began to warm to their touch against one another.  It was the warmest touch Renetta could remember having ever felt; it was the most soothing feeling she could presently imagine—and she had no desire to pull her hand away.                             
                                                                                                                                                                                         
It dawned on her as they smiled at one another, looking lovingly into each others eyes, and feeling the warmth of the window.  Her Reflection did not want into her apartment, or into her world—no more than she wanted into the reflection of her apparent on the other side—but rather only to be with one another, not being bound by the surface between them.

cqugo2s&AskReddit&empresselizabeth14&"My mom's a teacher and I've heard many a stories of teachers calling students things. I think the worst is when my second grade teacher was over at our house and I was sitting in the living room watching tv, next thing I know she says, ""You know I really can't stand working at a school filled with little n*****s. I mean half of them are going to be on crack by 7th grade."" Good news is she's retired so she can't be mean to students anymore. 

Then there was the time my mother came home and told me how one of her colleagues told her ""I swear I don't even mind Mexicans, but this girl I have smells like sour bean burritos. I mean do they even bathe in Mexico?"" She no longer works at the school and last I heard she works on the other side of the state. "

When I installed the fuel pressure gauge, I noticed it was running what that specific FPR is set at out of the box. I had the car tuned on this set up, and everything was in check, so I'll return the pressure to what it was before. I guess I shouldn't have tried to ""fix"" it :)

They've got 3 solid recruits and a transfer who is going to get good minutes, but they're just losing so much.

Even the second line of the [wikipedia page for misogyny] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny) says ""Misogyny can be manifested in numerous ways, including sexual discrimination, denigration of women, violence against women, and sexual objectification of women.""

Yes it does have defintion but let's be honest, no free marked is actually free in the purest sense. A free marked does not gaurantee you the right to sell something in someones store but it gives you the option to try and get it into the store.

It is hard to have this debate without touching on the main point, which is if you should be able to charge for your work.

This comes back to it not being a debate. It was them putting forth their point of view. TB has allready covered most of the oposing views in another video and he holds many of them himself. They did not describe people who disagreed with them as any of the above, that was reserved for people turning the debate into a shit fest. Unless, of course, I missed something. In case I did I would be very glad if you could what point in the video they say that everyone who disagree with us are psycopaths. I really do feel you have to do some hard work to somehow feel this was aimed at you.

In Nicks case I would also be slightly dismissive towards people  sending me death threats for wanting to get money for something I put years of work into. Especially if this attitude was not reflected in those he interact with in the community. That would make me feel like I was being unjustly attacked by outsiders, without that neccessarily being true.

Have you watched his, TB, previous video on the subject? The only thing he defended was the idea that you should be able to charge for your work if you want to. The rest he slammed, included the issues of noncompatible mods. 

That would also depend on the implimentation, but patreon, twitch and gom tv all lets you charge for content without any of it going under. Spotify charges so does netflix, people pay. 

I didnt intend to. I dont think a paywall is the solution, at least not a blanket paywall in which you put all the mods behind. Neither is TB for that mather. 

This is not a get rich quick scheme, most modders would not have a financial motive to charge for their work because the earning would be to slim. Not to mention that many do it to learn about game developing in which case you want as many as possible to try it. Many more still would not want to charge because they, like you, are purists. There would be some competition sure, but fighting over change is hardly worth it. 

Yes as they should have been, like TB said, towards what Valve sugested. I was against that as well, still am. I just suport the notion that if you worked on something you should have the option to get paid for it.

Inevitable actually:D This is not one of those old norse myths where man is slave to the fates. Modding will in all likelyhood not be a huge cash cow for 99% of the involved modder, and in many cases it will be better for game companys to let modders make their games more attractive to a larger audience without them baring that audience from entry by charging for the mod as well as the game. It is far from inevitable that all games will charge huge sums for all mods. That only happens if people actually buy it and if you do you have nobody to blame but yourself.

However, if Snapchat could set up two different wifis, then:  (1) the main wifi could be used for anything, and (2) the specific Snap wifi could allow all snaps to go to a central on-site server that distributes them at periodic intervals, or whatever would be necessary to reduce the load on that server or outgoing signal."

cqugobn&MechanicAdvice&rezikrisp&"I hope all those repairs weren't specifically for the noise. Sounds to me like you installed a bad wheel bearing or more likely, your tires are abnormally worn causing an awful noise while driving. Very easy to figure this out though, but requires a lift. 

Put it up in the air, get the vehicle up to speed with the traction control/ abs off, if the noise is gone there is a solid chance that its tires or maybe the component in question is not loaded enough. At this point I'd rotate the tires and see if it changes at all, though an experienced mechanic will know by the noise and how the tires look if they are the cause.

If the noise persist than our job just got easier. Take a stethoscope and probe around until you can pinpoint the noise, we're going to check anything that rotates at speed such as: wheel bearings, transmission, transfer case (if applicable), and front and rear diff (if applicable). Pretty simple to locate. Repairing most of these items won't be simple however.

The first step is to isolate the concern and locate it. Then move on to repair. "

Additionally a lot of the different Inquisition combinations give you small but interesting nuances even if you romance the same person over and over again with a different race or specialization even, while in Origins, there are mostly catch-alls (Morrigan doesn't treat you *too* differently if you are a Dwarf vs a Circle mage for example) so people probably have more initiative to do more romances for science! in Inquisition.

cqugocw&listentothis&Heartview&"/r/outrun and /r/newretrowave would be a good couple places to start. An odd recommendation probably, but you could also try /r/vaporwave or /r/futurefunk.

The first two would be more akin to Real Human ~~Bean~~ Being and Zephyr, as the genres are focused on giving a big 80's synthwave feel. Some notable examples would be things like:

[Lazerhawk - So Far Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39zKhsT5naI)
If you are really into the funk aspect of it, but Lazerhawk has a fair few albums each with some different styles to it, some more like this, some darker like [Skull and Shark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYvqDqoYXMY) and more 80's style stuff like [Redline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpDn4-Na5co)

Other huge outrun artists that I would consider staples would be [Kavinski - specifically Nightcall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV_3Dpw-BRY), [Power Glove - EP-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTyFfMAkSIs), and [Com Truise - In Decay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yergWdn968o)

New Retro Wave and Outrun have a lot of bleed across one another, but are usually rather similar. I tried to pick a few artists that use a bit more of the funk aspect, but the genres can be a bit aggressive at times too. I happen to be a huge fan of it though, and seeing as how you mentioned Real Human Being and Zephyr, it would be worth checking the genres out.

Understandably, if that's too aggressive, you might want to check out VaporWave. Its a weird genre for sure, but I think it might be right up your alley as well. There are many different subgenres in VaporWave, most of which would require more specific explaining, but /r/vaporwave is a fantastic place to start.

No reccomendation list for VaporWave would be right if it didnt start with some of the essentials like [Chuck Person - Eccojams Vol. 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8fM-CGQVCY) and [Macintosh Plus's Floral Shoppe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcsYSJwewWk). Another example you might like is [Saint Pepsi, now Skylar Spence - Hit Vibes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r2zleGxv7w) and [.CASTING - Late To Be Real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xoeHeFCLfk)

This might be a weird list of recommendations, but if you hear anything you like let me know so I can hope to find more of that style for you, as the range of music here is rather... I guess broad?"

cqugoeh&Frugal&AuntRhubarb&"Okay, if chlorine is the main problem that has a workaround.  It is actually a dissolved gas in the water.  So if you just fill up a  jug and set it on the counter un-capped, the chlorine will dissipate/evaporate and go away, give it a couple hours.  I just keep a jug or two in rotation to use for coffee making, sodastream, etc.   

If you still have objections other than chlorine, there are lots of good ideas in this thread.  Personally for pure drinking water, I just use distilled because there is nothing in except water molecules.  And somebody upthread says you can buy a distiller unit if you don't want to buy bottled distilled.   I think I may look into that.

cqugoej&AskReddit&vegetablesareawesome&"I kind of had an intimate moment with one of my closest friends after a bottle of wine a couple years ago and then he just never called me back. We had been friends for 5 years. It still seems so surreal that he just never tried to get in touch with me again.

I often have dreams that he comes to pick me up from somewhere. Sometimes he apologizes and tells me he was wrong and just scared. Most of the time, he's just as smug as he always was.

Last time he picked me up at an airport in Boston and I wasn't sure if I wanted to go with him. At the last second, I got into the back seat and said, ""I'm coming with you."" And he looked at me in the rear-view mirror and smirked, ""I know."""

If it was order through fascism, the hunters all have that absolute power.  We can't even die.  Our force is so absolutely unrelenting.  That power comes at a cost, and it functions in a hierarchy.

Gehrman is someone I think being controlled or rather, influenced, but it just makes me think that each choice you make has consequences to be considered.  Gehrman being left in the nightmare is one of those.  I think Yharnam may very well be doomed, but the ending seems metatextual to me.  Yharnam isn't real, for us.  That has its own implications to me.  The doom itself is false, but in terms of staying in character, I do think there's a lot to be answered for.  "

cqugog0&summonerschool&azuresou1&"Thanks for the guide - fellow Vlad main here climbing up the ladder. Had some questions:

1 - Have you tried out Spell Vamp quints vs. MS? I'm currently running SV which seems to help in lane as well as late game, but I wanted to get your take on it. Also, why a mix of Flat and Scaling CDR blues? Scaling CDR seems to be far more efficient.

2 - I have literally never beaten Swain in lane. Ever. I can't afford to trade, so I play safe, but then he pushes wave into tower and resets, and next thing you know I'm down 30 CS by level 9. By the time I get a jungle gank, he's strong enough to 2v1 us and the game is over. Any more tips for this lane from hell (which basically says to let him shove to tower, which I already do)?

3. Vlad has lots of HARD counters. Safe to say that he's better as a 'counter' pick than a blind pick?"

Tell him you are aware of her, don't have an issue with him seeing other women (since that's what you agreed to and you're still fine with that), but that you have an issue with risking your health. The current situation is not acceptable to you so he has 3 choices: dump her, dump you, or start using condoms with you (the fourth choice of starting to use condoms with her is not acceptable because you have no way of knowing whether he is actually doing so). Be prepared that he may dump you. However I think he will respect you candor and dump her or just start using condoms with you. Good luck.

There is a low possibility of indirect reflection if the photons have enough energy (gamma-ray photons become electron/antielectron pairs, interact, pairs annihilate into new photons doing something different). The angle the photons leave at is random, but the probability distribution is calculable from quantum electrodynamics.

We're dangerously close to a cliff or ledge or driving over a bridge over water. I keep saying ""you're getting really close, be careful"" and whoever is driving is telling me to be quiet and saying ""Stop, I know what I'm doing"" I get angrier as they get closer and closer, then finally they end up driving off the edge and we plunge into the water. I start freaking out as the car fills up thinking ""wow I'm actually gonna die like this.""  
Lately though, instead of freaking out as it fills up, I'm just really mad, then when we finally drive off, I'm preparing the fastest way possible to open the door/break the glass and escape. Usually thinking ""I told you, you idiot..."" :|"
cqugokj&1911&Metengineer&"I have a colt mark IV that I can shoot both 9mm and .38 super. I also have a Springfield in .45 ACP. I shoot the 9mm much more often. Getting the 1911 trigger and slim grip and easy shooting of 9mm in a steel frame gun perfect for me.

As far as parts are concerned, the only difference between my two guns is the barrel, bushing, recoil spring, extractor and ejector. The only different design is the ramped barrel. I have had no problem finding parts. You don't need a full length guide rod. 

Edit: I forgot the slide will have a bit different breach face and barrel opening. But just a different size not design."

By all means if you have any evidence they are actually playing games with you then leave and don't go back.

However,  I worked for a dealership for many years and it is a first come first serve business. I witnessed several occasions where we had several customers call in or show up on the same car. Just because it sells in an hour or two before you arrive does not guarantee it was a scam. 

This is exactly why customers are often warned that the car could be sold while they are at home deciding. It's not a trick. It's the truth.

cqugomh&ukpolitics&Delstein&"Well it's really a matter of how many seats each party gets and if they can command the confidence of the House. That just means a majority of the House of Commons supports the government in place, as I understand it. The SNP in Scotland are expected to get no more than 5% of the nationwide vote, because they only have candidates in Scotland. However, they might get 55 of the 59 Scottish seats. UKIP stand candidates across the country, and might get 3 times the SNP's vote, but only one or two seats. 

The SNP is a left-wing party, more so than Labour, and they have made clear that they won't do a deal with the Tories. They might support Labour vote-by-vote, but not in a full coalition, as we have had since 2010. There is another hung parliament (no party with a majority) expected this time, and so if Labour want to form a government with their 260 to 280 predicted seats, they need the SNP to reach the 326-seat majority mark.

It is a matter of seats, and not the number of left or right wing parties, that will influence negotiations after 7 May. "

And who are you to say whether or not a culture was worth preserving or not? What was the point you are making? That you are a white dickbag? You are not in a position to do that - though you believe you are because you're so entitled. 

If you insist on telling yourself that slavery or racism against blacks in general is not a reason for black poverty in the US (because other minorities are in better shape? reality check: they're not. but they don't get the brunt of the hate from whites. also stop mentioning jews. they didnt face any discrimination IN THE UNITED STATES. you dont see blacks complaining about poverty in some other country.), then so be it lol.

The main reason is that CELTA is very much an introductory course, so the trainers are assessing if you will be able to train up on the job without shooting your self in the foot too often. Thus it concentrates on the nuts and bolts of classroom management  and lesson planning in an EFL context.

I know  trainers that have moved on to teach a wider range of subjects, but when they chat about their lessons they are always very clearly tefl trainers in their approach if not in their subject. This is one of the great things about being a tefl trainer- if you can tefl well you can teach anything well. "

cqugoo8&Jurisprudence&Cadetastic&"Interesting question.  I'd tend to believe that the medication is legally owned by the mother, particularly if the mother paid for it.  If the 17 year old paid then maybe the outcome is different.


I will argue that the answer shouldn't be different just because the mother isn't giving them to her as prescribed.  If the mother legally owns the medication then misuse wouldn't just legally default the ownership to the teen absent judicial intervention.  Of course, the mother could possibly be investigated for child neglect at that point, and a judge could take away parental rights (to include the right to make medical decisions for her daughter).

cqugoow&makemychoice&Mremerkin&"In my specialty, our sea/shore rotation was 5yrs/2yrs -- which meant that I spent 5 years on sea duty for every two years on shore duty. Much of that time was spent at sea, and while deployed we stood watch 12hrs on/12hrs off. It was rough, but you got used to it. Not much time for college courses and when you were on shore duty, you wanted to live it up .. or I did, so didn't do much in that direction. While you're on a ship you don't have much room for personal possessions, but over time you can bring larger items if your work space permitted. Had a surfboard for the longest time just in case we hit port where surfing was a thing. 

But that's only 1/2 of the Navy. Some sailors never go to sea (Seabees), some less frequently than others, every rate has different rotations, so it's hard to say what you'd wind up in.

cqugop2&rocketbeans&Bertan-44&"Zunächst ein kleines Vorwort zur Debatte ob solche Klassiker als Hausaufgabe gestellt werden sollten und dazu sage ich nur ein klares JA! Ich zum Beispiel bin 19 Jahre alt und versuche die meisten Klassiker zu gucken und Goodfellas hatte ich schon gesehen, aber wie bei Schröckert und co. war bei mir das letzte Mal auch relativ lange her also fand ich es klasse einen Anlass zu haben den Film wieder zu gucken. Und allgemein an die Hausaufgabe: Ich finde ihr solltet ab und zu auch Klassiker wie jetzt mit Goodfellas als Hausaufgabe stellen, denn die Hausaufgabe ist ja schließlich nicht nur da um versteckte Perlen zu entdecken sondern auch einfach um über Klassiker der Filmgeschichte zu diskutieren also sehe ich da gar kein Problem und wünsche mir da mehr von! 

Nun zum Film. Goodfellas ist ein zeitloser Klassiker der Filmgeschichte und gehört mit weitem Abstand zu den besten Filmen von Martin Scorsese (eine Schande dass er dafür nicht den Oscar gewonnen hat). Der Film weiß einfach nur zu gefallen. Die Handlung ist intelligent und fesselnd und die Erzählweise durch die Monologe von Ray Liotta und Lorraine Bracco ist genial. So unterschiedlich die drei Hauptcharaktere doch sind, so sehr gefallen sie dem Zuschauer, da sie der Handlung eine weitere Tiefe und dem gesamten Film einen ganz eigenen Charme und Charakter verleihen. Vor allem das Temperament und die verrückte Art von Joe Pesci ist immer wieder schön anzuschauen. Goodfellas ist ohne Frage einer der besten Gangster Filme aller Zeiten und ist wie Der Pate gut gealtert (wenn nicht sogar besser. Gab genügend Leute in meinem Freundeskreis denen das langsame Tempo des Paten nicht gefallen hat). Ein weiteres Kompliment muss ich der Kameraführung geben. Irwin Winkler hat stets aus super Perspektiven gefilmt und hat mit nicht so vielen Schnitten gearbeitet, wodurch der Film sehr flüssig und nicht zu hektisch wirkt. Goodfellas muss man einfach mögen, vor allem wenn man wie ich eine große Leidenschaft für Gangster Filme hat. In dem Sinne kann ich abschließend nur sagen: Danke Martin Scorsese für dieses zeitlose Meisterwerk und Danke Schröckert, Ede und Andy für diese Hausaufgabe!"

cqugoq0&collapse&ChesterD&"This is partly political.  Iran is no doubt behind the times when it comes to desalination, but that is likely driven in part by economic sanctions.  Any nuke deal would likely see a flood of new desal technology into the country.  

Saudi Arabia is currently [the largest producer of desalinated water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Saudi_Arabia) in the world.  About half of its water comes from desal plants.  And much of the latest investment is in [solar-powered desal technology](http://cleantechnica.com/2015/01/22/worlds-largest-solar-powered-desalination-plant-under-way/).  Which is pretty forward thinking and prety cool.  Israel gets 35% of its water from desal.  Oman, Bahrain, and the UAE are not far behind.  Israel projects [more than 70% of its water](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desalination#Existing_facilities_and_facilities_under_construction) will come from desalination by mid-century.  Desalination and waste management is the only way forward for places like the Middle East and Caribbean.  However, they have money.

Physical water scarcity is likely to be less of a problem than economic water scarcity.  Migration due to economic water scarcity is already wreaking havoc in places like Bangladesh and central Africa.  [20% of the deaths in Bangladesh](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/37958050/ns/health-health_care/) can be attributed to poisoned drinking water. 

There's no doubt tens of millions of people will die from a lack of clean drinking water in the next decade.  But those people won't be from the Middle East.  The Middle East is rich.  It's the poorest of the poor who will die."

cqugose&casualiama&Ted_Flanders&"We have the right to inspect any box we feel is suspicious or contains something dangerous. Even things that seem tame. For instance, we cannot accept boxes contains dry ice because the fumes they create can incapacitate a pilot/flight crew in the air. For stuff like that they have to ship directly from a hub so they can be inspected. The only time someone is required to show us the contents of their shipment is if they want to declare a large value, that way we can insure the contents are not already damaged and that they are properly packaged to avoid damage.
As for the juicy stuff like bombs and drugs, the authorities should be notified. We have manuals upon manuals that are dictionary thick that try and prepare us for every scenario but to be totally honest, unless it smells, it's leaking, ticking, or wires are coming out of it, and the person shipping it is smart, we probably won't even know. If you come in and hand me a pre-labeled box, it goes on the rack for pickup. If you tell me there's no declared value and it's a clean box that's packed well, I have no reason to open it. Once it gets to the shipping hub, I'm not sure of their process, but when it comes in my store, I do what's required of me and that's it. 
Personally, if you're shipping a bomb or something that's going to be potentially hazardous to me or anyone else, I'm letting SOMEONE know. If you're a 19 year old kid shipping a dimebag of weed to your buddy in the battery compartment of CD player, I'm not saying shit."

There's weather that contradicts the misnomer ""global warming"" when it's taken at a literal face value, but that's totally moot, since it is, as I said, a misnomer.

No climate change proponent believes that all weather all the time will be X, Y, or Z. Most believe that trends will continue shifting towards extremes, as is stated in the links I gave and as I originally stated in my first post.

It's just a broad ""stick your finger in the wind"" measure of equality. It doesn't say if a film is good or bad or if it's particular feminist. Given all things equal, a film should have a diversity of gender and on average films are as likely to have two women discussing something other than a man (surprisingly not as common as one should expect) as a film is likely to have two men discussing something other than a woman (which is pretty common place).

The fact that films so frequently fail the Bechdel test, to me, is an indicator of inequality of gender. "

That being said, I would say the Army and the Marines certainly place similar levels of responsibility (probably more so in the USMC) on SPCs/Cpls. I really can't speak for the junior AF ranks, most of my interactions with them have been at the senior NCO and officer levels."

Bread is so widespread because it's a cheap, voluminous, available means of delivering carbohydrates. Also because wheat, and its grassy relatives, are found widely around the world.

Cultures that do not eat plentiful bread (Eastern Asia, Americas) surely have a substitute that's equally as prevalent in their cuisine, such as rice, corn, quinoa, or whatever."

cqugoz2&wargame&frankwouter&"Disclaimer: I only play 3v3 and up.

 * I would replace humvee for tacom in humvee, the map is small and it easy to smerch the humvee. 

 * You only have 6 aa vihicles, of which 4 can hit helicopters. Consider adding an avenger, it has great damage output and gives you some numbers. 

 * I would go m8 ags + m1ip over m1ip + m1a1. For slugfests you want the best superheavy in the games.  M8ags + m1ip has amazing damage output and the m1ip makes a great meatshield. 

 * Your cheapest recon is 45 pts. Does this allow you to have enough recon everywhere? I like the humvee mk19 as cheap recon/fire support. The cobra is redundant with your helicopter tab.

 * You missed the best vehicle, the CEV. Get that one in there. The comvat is a super strv9040 in the vehicle tab. It destroys bmps's and lighter tanks in the forest. Also stuns infantry easily. I would go for cev and ontos/zippo.

 * A little bird is a nice fire support helicopter, but the cobra should be a nice cheap all in one gunship.

Nice deck, but it is really light on aa and lacks cheap recon.

So this is my fourth account. The first three I reached 4000+ karma in 1-2 months, and got a snoovatar from gold on two of them. I'm not particularly funny or insightful, so it's just be sheer brute force and constant commenting and posting that I reach those numbers, very modest for a season veteran, but obscene for a college student. After every time I reach 4000 Karma I take a long look in the mirror, full of disgust and self-hate, and say to myself ""never again."" And yet, here I am.

When I got the phone call, I was just really put off, so I wasn't bluffing at all when I tried to cancel it.

The reason they won't work in your example is because function declarations are statements while lambdas are expressions and the language is more restrictive on where statements are allowed. Its the same reason `if x = 2:` is a error."

cqugozu&ballpython&efro4472&I've never used a ceramic heat bulb but I do have a heat lamp. It's just a regular 43watt bulb. I have a night lamp too and that is a 50watt bulb.  My thermostat regulates them by turning them off when the temp gets too high. I'd like to switch to a thermostat that regulates voltage instead of turning the lamps on and off but it's no big deal. I switch out the lamps before bed and after waking up. It seems like a pain but I really like it because I always mist while I'm at the tank anyways. I feel that if I had a ceramic bulb plus a daylight,  it would be harder to maintain humidity because too much air would flow through. I have a screen top but I keep it covered with a combination of two wet rags and aluminum foil.  I'm getting off topic. Wattage isn't too important if you'll have a thermostat regulating them when it gets too hot.

Sometime there are main story lines that continue or are common through skit to skit, and even episode to episode.

cqugp1i&DnDBehindTheScreen&cmyers84&"If you want to properly simulate how frequent a result is on a table, it's a good idea to have it appear more than once. Since each number on the die has the same chance to appear as any other (assuming the die is ""fair""), the only way you can simulate frequency of a result is to manipulate the table. If you go this route, I'd suggest using a larger table than what 2-20 would provide.

As others have pointed out, leaving items blank is redundant. You can probably fill them with a reference to a non-combat encounter table. Now, one thing you can do is have some encounters only happen a set number of times. Do this would make sense because as you kill off wandering monsters, you're less likely to encounter them."

cqugp51&personalfinance&CannibalAngel&"I have little to no knowledge of programmin but I can imagine that programming for video games it VERY different than programming for a web site. That and with the video game industry getting bigger and bigger and more and more people seeing it as a way to make good money the market is likely flooded. You are going to have to be very good and be able to prove it to break into it.



I'm not trying to discourage you but these are the facts. If that is what you really want to do then do it. Look on codeacademy.com and get some programming books on-line or from your local library. I would suggest writing your own game and trying to get it published as an Indy title to get your name out there. Good luck."

cqugp69&survivor&thisismyspot&"As much as I hate will for bringing up stuff that was uncalled for and Dan being a delusional shithead. Shirin triggering the annoyance emotion in just one evening at ponderosa makes me think we should not forget how annoying she and Max were and how poorly they played the social game with absolutely no self-awareness. 

Shirin 's wake up call was when Max was voted out and she had no one who cared to take her into their alliance even though it was an extra vote. 

I am sympathetic to what happened to her and how it should never ever happen to anyone ever in a game ,I probably wanted her to win not because of the way she played it's because of the unjust way she was treated and a revenge win sounded good .. 

But in the scheme of things and from a game perspective that's not who I want to be a winner unless she had some moves to show she not only cared to make a point but had the armor to back it up . 

She failed at the very beginning when it mattered , Max and her had a tug of war as to who would drag the other down the fastest and that is truly a shame cos I would have happily rooted for either of them if they were not so tightly wound and counting survivor winner sun sign tally ..

go Tyler/Mike for what it's worth ! "
