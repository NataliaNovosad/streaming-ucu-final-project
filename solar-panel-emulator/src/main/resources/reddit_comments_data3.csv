cqugxdk&funny&EskayPen&"Sorry, grammar nerd approaching. These are examples of why the Oxford comma is occasionally necessary. Usually it's a bad idea, for the exact reason that it is unnecessary. The ""and"" at the end of almost any list does the job that a final comma would do. The only exception is when you are listing three things that could be taken to be the same thing, which is extraordinarily rare.

If I say ""my favorite colors are purple, silver and green,"" no one thinks that silver and green are describing purple."

cqugxf9&residentevil&REsoleSurvivor1000&"Going in reverse here but here's my thoughts on your costumes:

- Helena sounds like a cool idea especially as a Gina skin. Voices are similar so it works here.

- Excella is a great idea for Alex. Also pretty similar.

- Sherry as Moira? Excellent.

- Kinda iffy here. Would look great but some voice work would be needed or else it would be kinda weird.

- I think Piers would work great as a Neil skin. Defs good choice (also unrelated but I think they need a monster Neil skin too).

- Jessica as Jill is a good idea too. I like it.

I think Ada should have been an addition from the start as well. Although I don't know how her grappling gun function would work considering there isn't a physic in the game for it as well as usable locations. Could act as a whip attack or something though! This I'd be okay with.

Also I might be the only one in this boat, but I was a pretty big fan of some of the characters in ORC so people like Vector (could be a HUNK skin) and Spectre would make great additions IMO. The voices are *fairly* similar so it would be very little to minimal work at best. Thoughts?"

cqugxgc&genderqueer&Thatdoctorperson&"Gender and sexuality have no link. Any gender can be any sexuality. Terminology is different due to everything being based of binary genders. Here goes better terminology that I think everyone should use.

Androsexual: attracted to men

Gynosexual: attracted to woman

Skoliosexual: attracted to us gender queer folk

Multisexual: attracted to more than one gender

Bisexual: attracted to two or more undefined genders

Pansexual: attracted to all of the genders (Me :D)

There are many more terms but those are some of my favorites as they are not gender based

Side not - bisexual is generally interpreted as attracted to men and woman but it doesn't have to."

There is a difference between the price at which you can buy a stock and the price at which you can sell it. That's how a 'market maker' makes money, off this difference, or 'spread.' Historically, the difference between these two numbers could be 1% of the stock price, or more. 

Now, because of high frequency traders making it easier to execute trades for everyone, that spread has narrowed tenfold. That means it is much less costly for anyone that transacts in the markets to do business. They essentially made the system much more efficient and took a lot of money out of the pockets of Wall Street"

Beyond that, you could read the first full novel, ""Blood of Elves"", which introduces you to the rest of the witchers as well as Triss, and [also gives you a glimpse into Ciri's powers as well].(#spoiler)"

Don't eat chocolate, ration your meals appropriately, and you'll see results within a month or two. Coupled with exercise.. 

It really just takes 3-5 months of motivation, and the rest you will start to see and be stoked about, so you won't need motivating.

cqugxjz&vita&talkingwires&"Weird, I just finished responding to a Hardcore Risette Fan question on the /r/vita front page, and here's another! Well, I'll just copy/paste my tips from that thread:

* Play on Hard or higher difficulty. If you're over-leveled, you'll miss many of her lines.

* You will have to use all of the characters. In your next playthrough, get to the top of each dungeon, exit, switch out all your characters, and start again from the bottom. Look for enemies that cause status ailments, and keep fighting them with every character until you've heard all the lines associated with that ailment.

* Don't guard or heal characters. Let them get knocked down and affected with status ailments. Each effect on each character has two or three lines associated with getting inflicted with each ailment.

* Don't level up your party's S. Links. Doing so will let characters help each other recover from effects. Rise has dozens of lines for characters recovering from ailments on their own.

* Do level up Rise's S. Link as fast as you can. The lines she says about enemies' weakness at the beginning of each battle count. She also has many lines for when she helps you in battle, including taking damage for you and recovering knocked out characters.

* You can try scanning every enemy you fight, but there's no clear consensus whether those lines count or not. I did it anyway.

I got the trophy in the Hollow Forest on my first playthrough, but I was actively trying to get it to pop. Some people get lucky and get it without trying, but I've heard of others doing three or more playthroughs and never getting it.

cqugxkg&wow&cookieskylark&"Mistweaver Monk, Holy Priest, Resto Shaman, Resto Druid, Holy Paladin, Disc Priest.

Mistweavers are super interactive and their healing style is, imo, revolutionary. 

Holy priest is awesome because you can blanket everyone with your healing, but it's not all instant casts like a druid. So you have to weave in casts as well. 

Resto shamans are amazing at clump healing and emergency healing. It's easy to get a constant burst going. 

Resto druids are extremely mobile, because almost everything they do is instant cast. 

Holy paladin is an extremely stand still spec with amazing burst potential and it's always awesome to see all your shields everywhere. 

Disc priests are fun when you have the words of mending talent, but clarity of will kind of turns them into a CoW turret. But weaving archangel in your ""rotation"" makes it fun as well.

The enemy poisoned seven others against the empire. One remembered the Lethani and did not betray their city. The names of the seven traitors are remembered. The names of the one and the six that follow him.

Then it follows that the Enemy must be within those 7 names, right? But it says that these were the names of the 7 traitors. How can the Enemy be a traitor?"

cqugxqi&NightVision&Centra_spike&"There are a bunch of systems out there, all intended for different uses, but I'm going to assume (since you said ""weapon"") that you're looking for something for self defense/range class/airsoft usage, which is, to say, a tactical usage. Luckily, there are a number of kits you could assemble for around your stated budget. The major components are as follows:


* Nods- Gen. 3 PVS-14's: These are U.S. Standard issue, and if you hunt on eBay, you can find them at $1500 or lower. Unless you're offered a really sweet deal on Gen. 2's (sub-1k) don't bother. The Gen. 3 tubes will probably have less hours. There's a bunch of different distinctions on the tubes, some will say ""OMNI"" some will say ""Thin Film,"" these terms won't make a big difference for you, just get a cheap used starter pair, and if you want to upgrade, they'll hold their value pretty well. The PVS-14 has a lot of aftermarket support in terms of parts and knowledge, plus, with an adapter, you can co-witness it with a compatible red dot, making it weapon mountable. 


* Mounting Solution- Wilcox L4 G11 and USGI J-arm: Beware the sticker shock when shopping for a mount, they are pricey. This combo will cost you about $300, which sounds insane for a few small pieces of metal and plastic... until you consider that this is what keeps your $1500+ device attached to your head. There's also a lot of engineering that goes into these little things: ergonomics, metallurgy, mechanical. The above combo is middle of the road, you could go cheaper with a older generation USGI Rhino, or higher quality with an INVG or L4 G24, but this is the best balance between cost and performance, IMHO. Better to get one at a place like TNVC.com, eBay is full of fakes.


* Helmet- Team Wendy LTP: I have one and I love it. Many people prefer a helmet to a ""skullcrusher"" holding their system on their head. There are two basic options, the LTP, and the Ops Core Base Jump. These are ""bump"" helmets, basically custom skateboard helmets, and both companies have more advanced (and expensive) models for sale. Each helmet has a special system that prevents the helmet from slipping forward from the weight of the NVG, as well as rails to attach accessories like action cams and flashlights, and a molded-in socket to connect the mount to. You can buy mounts separately, but why bother? The LTP is my choice because it has a metal insert that forms a much more solid connection with the mount.


* Other Stuff: Buying night vision is the start of a long, expensive journey. You're eventually going to want a whole host of other stuff. A weapon mounted, long range IR illuminator will help you identify far away targets. An IR laser will allow you to aim and snap shoot (sights become useless). An IR strobe allows you to broadcast your position to friendly (and unfriendly) NVG users. IR chemlights allow you to mark terrain features, among other uses. A counterweight pouch will ease the strain on your neck, a sacrificial lens is a good investment against breaking an objective, it goes on and on. 


So I hope I've given you some idea of the complexity of the subject. It's expensive but also pretty cool when you can sneak up on your buddies in the dark. Good luck!"

cqugxqv&Futurology&mungalodon&"Aging is just an accumulation of genetic, epigenetic, molecular, and biochemical imperfections. Granted it's a multifactorial clusterfuck, there are likely shitloads on shitloads of accumulated imperfections that contribute to one degree or another, it's probably among the most complex of diseases, **but** there are not an unknowable or infinite number. Sure, those imperfections in sum are unknowable by any human and **currently** unprocessable by any computer. If sequencing tech and processing power continue to exponentially decrease in cost and more researchers continue to stream into related fields, it's definitely not unreasonable to expect indefinite life extension in most of our lifetimes. 

Just kind of as an important aside, you can't look back at the last X years of biomedical research and extrapolate that forward linearly. Simple example: I expect I have about 60 years left with our current technology. Looking back over the last 60 years of biomedical research, about since the discovery of DNA structure, we see we've accomplished quite a bit, right. Similar amounts of progress would not take another 60 years. In the coming 60 years we'll see a billion-fold increase in processing power and about a hundred-fold increase in the primary literature, a simple metric for scientific knowledge (though there is evidence that the rate of exponential growth of the literature is also increasing, so a hundred-fold increase may be conservative). I'm not even taking into account AI, though it seems likely it too will be developed in this period (not my area of expertise, so I can't really comment on it too much). 

So yes, it is very much theoretically possible. There have been many early experiments in animal models that reinforce that life extension is not impossible."

I also like having a locator markers every 8 bars in the arrangement view (I just save a template set with markers on it already). Then you can bind keys to the ""next/prev"" locator buttons and use them to scrub through your arrangement by section instead of using the mouse/playhead tool."

cqugxus&news&Binxly&"Take your own advice.  As someone who has experience in this arena of psychology and working in the health care field, something I am 100% sure you aren't within, understand fact and science *supports* this reality that gender is defined in the brain, NOT the body's physical sexual characteristics.  Mind you, the lions share of brains match the body, and I'm supremely over-simplifying the description but only because to go into it, anyone anti trans would stop reading because, with all the science, education and knowledge on the subject in the past ten years, those against it but willing to read the facts (ie - me 10 years ago, a staunch opposing party of transexuality as a legit issue and transition as the solution) have since read and studied these reports and cases and realized my former biases were incorrect.

Those still against it are so because they are either projecting their own sexual insecurities onto those whom transition and/or they just find it altogether 'icky' and will cling to anything (Christian 'Scientist' nonsense, The Bible, the very small minority of the post-transition community who 'regret' their decision) in order to latch onto the belief that this just CANNOT be legit.  To admit as such would be to admit sexuality and gender is not binary and therefore cause simple persons to, *GASP*, have to actually realize life isn't black and white in its simplicity..."

cqugxvs&VideoEditing&Kichigai&"More a /r/videography question than an editing question, but what's happening is your shutter speed is too high. You're able to see the flash because of [persistence of vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision) but modern CCD and CMOS cameras do *not* operate in that way. So if your camera is running at a shutter speed of say 1/2000 it's only taking in light for one two thousandth of a second, and that flash might be happening in the other 1999^(th)s of a second, and persisting for less than a frame.

If you can knock it down to the 1/60 range you might be able to make it happen, but that'd require an extremely small aperture to make it happen. 1/30 would be better. The problem is then that you're losing a lot of crispness in your motion, and introducing more motion blur."

cqugxvy&TrueAtheism&Invicta_Homo&"Why does truth have value? What motivation should I have to seek it? Just because? Because society wants me to be a good boy and follow the rules? Science can't answer moral questions. You shouldn't expect it to. I don't need science to tell me what I enjoy. I don't need science to tell me what is good. You seem to enjoy lecturing, but why? What value does truth have? Why must truth have value if one's perspective is relative? Why does truth have value to a man, and not to a rock? The only value that truth has to me is in pain/pleasure. 

You claim that I am arrogant and yet, you yourself are equally guilty, claiming hegemony on knowledge. You're just as dogmatic as religious people. By the way, give me just one reason why I shouldn't follow hedonism. I've found it to be the most sensible way to live my life. I've found myself happier and more fulfilled. The only meaning in life that I can see is in finding happiness. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there is more to life. But since I can't know of anything else, it would be a foolish assumption to believe there is something more. If I wasn't happy, suicide would be the most logical choice. That means that hedonism is true."

Do I also need to pull up information where I've seen that if anyone dares say anything bad about his company, like the juice isn't good or this post questioning the quality of the 70% the juice order it has to be from some competition that I've read from other places?  You know that people honestly can't have a concern about the juice and OMG if anyone dares say anything negative towards Mitten it can't be from a genuine person it has to be from some great conspiracy.  Not long ago I brought up that one of their flavors wasn't create by them and the ""goon squad"" decided to question whether or not I was a real person because OMG I said something negative because I knew where the source of said flavor actually came from.

cqugxwq&TrueChristian&UnimatrixZeroOne&"Well, we can't always name people we brought to Christ. There are many ways to witness to someone and sometimes that doesn't involve giving a name. I just wanted to say this so that people who have impacted God's Kingdom don't feel like they aren't as important because they don't know the name of said person.

There's also the fact that you never know how many people you've caused to be brought to God. Let's put it this way, if the person (A) brings someone (B) to God, then the person (B) that was brought to God brings someone (C) else to God, then the person (A) who brought B to God is partially responsible for C as well. A person impacting one life can lead to a million lives being impacted. 

Then there is online where you can post anything that could bring someone to God, but not everyone is going to say to the poster that the poster's post brought them to God, so you may not know you brought someone to God when you have.

I know for a fact I brought someone to Christ, but I do not know their name. It actually happened one night when I was 13. The person had messaged the wrong number, and for some reason we got to talking which led to me talking about the gospel and him coming to Christ. I know of a few atheists that I've spoken to who have at least become agnostic. I'd like to think that some of those atheists became Christians and have led others to Christ as well. 

I wish I had done more so far, but, with how much we move, it is hard to gain meaningful friendships which makes it harder to witness to someone and have them listen. I am planning on becoming a doctor and working with the CDC as someone who goes to different places to help treat outbreaks. I am doing this because I want to help save people's lives and also because I want to help bring people to Christ. People are more willing to listen to someone who just saved their life or their family member's/friend's life rather than some stranger who has done nothing for them. I believe it is an opportunity to witness to people who've never heard the gospel."

cqugxx8&atheism&dudleydidwrong&"That makes the old testament conveniently irrelevant, although it does contradict what the Book of Matthew clearly states.  There are a lot of apologetics devoted to getting around Matthew, but the intent is clear in the context of the entire book.

How do you rationalize not following rules set out in the New Testament?  Also, modern Christians don't seem overly concerned with the relaxed standard set of rules set out in Acts.  Eating meat from sacrifices is not a problem in modern society, but most modern Christians are not even aware of the blood and strangled meat restrictions.  They are widely ignored.  Modern Christians are hung up on  sexual issues, but only the homosexual forms of sex generate serious outrage. Other forms of sexual immorality may be verbally renounced, but infractions are commonly ignored in everyone except teenagers."

You probably did this post because of my post earlier. Still bitching around huh? I asked for a powerlevel, yes. Oh and guess why I cannot give you a powerlevel in return? You are right, I simply CAN'T. My 70 crusader still walks around with yellow crap gear and I wanted my friend to farm with me at lvl 70 thus asking for someone to spare 30 minutes of his time. Then some retard people kept telling me that I could easily plevel him because I already have a 70 char, guess what after hitting lvl 50-60 it will take hours to lvl up. So stop your bullshit, because there are actually nice people out there who will help guys out who need some quick boost.

cqugxz6&dxm&jessebird11&"Meditation is actually very smart to do while coming up. (I've never tried meditating before a come up, but from my meditation experience this is my thoughts) Dxm allows you to ""leave"" your body, while enhancing certain thoughts and enhancing sounds. If you are adept at meditation, you could start right after you dose (which could help combat nausea and ""the rush"" occasionally felt) and before you know it, your traditional method of meditation is interrupted by weird thoughts and swirling geometric space awesome dextroverse ships, ect. Whereas, if you're an amateur you could start roughly 40-20 minutes after your initial dose. At best, if you have a hard time keeping a full meditative state, start meditating as soon as you feel something. This is a smart idea and might be a link to starting doses off much higher than normal without the side effects. I will test this out next trip. Thank you. "

cqugy2r&askscience&Anacanthros&"Aaaaah.  You're an engineer.  OK, let me take another crack at this.

What you basically need to understand is that a neuron has a voltage across its membrane at all times, that that voltage is due to a complex (im)balance of different ions.  When the neuron isn't doing anything, some current leaks across the membrane, but there are ""ion pumps"" that move all of the ions back to where they are supposed to be and maintain the cell's membrane voltage, sort of like pumping water uphill.  This potential difference is a source of potential energy, which the neuron can then translate into rapid fluctuations in membrane potential when required.

Now, here is the tricky thing:  Because so many parts of the neuron are so thin *AND* because the membrane is literally covered with various mechanisms that work to keep the membrane potential riht where it is, a change in membrane potential at *one* location in the neuron does not instantly cause a change in membrane potential throughout the rest of the neuron.  An influx of current into the cell can only alter the membrane voltage *locally*, because the influx of current won't make it very far down a dendrite or axon or what-have-you.  This is especially true because whatever event caused the influx of current is usually transient.

So, all that the opening of some neurotransmitter-gated channels at a synapse can really do is temporarily and locally make the membrane potential less negative.

UNLESS there are enough such events that they add up to enough to raise the membrane voltage from its resting state (-70 mV) to a magical threshold (usually around -55 mV).  If there's enough current coming in to raise the membrane potential (specifically, the membrane potential at the part of the cell body called the [axon hillock](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Axon_Hillock.png) by those 15 millivolts, then something magical happens.

Special voltage-gated sodium channels are triggered when the voltage goes above -55 mV.  They allow huge influxes of current into the cell, which are strong enough to furhter raise the membrane voltage all the way up above zero, and actually make the inside of the cell temporarily *positive* (up to about +40 mV).  Then a bunch of other mechanisms take over and shoot the membrane potential back down belwo -70.  This part lasts under a millisecond.

But the amount of current that flows in during that millisecond is *just* enough to flow a ways down the axon, and raise the membrane voltage *in the first little stretch of the axon* up to the threshold of -55 mV.  So then there's a huge influx of sodium ions *there*.  And then that influxof current flows down the axon a little further, and triggers voltage gated sodium channels *there*, and so on.  

So there's a slightly more in-depth version.  At every single point along the entire cell's membrane, the membrane voltage of -70 millivolts is being tirelessly maintained.  Chemical signals from other cells can let in enough current to change the membrane voltage a little bit, locally.  But sometimes those signals add up to enough to raise the membrane voltage enough that it results in a (very brief) positive feedback loop, which lets in enough current to actually change the membrane voltage at *neighboring* spots on the membrane, which turns it into a chain reaction that can propagate all the way down the axon to the terminal.  And that's called an action potential.

Then at the terminal a bunch of other really complicated stuff happens.  Basically, current flowing into the terminal and changing the membrane voltage in the terminal causes the terminal to spit out gobs of neurotransmitter.  Which can then go help start the whole process over in another neuron.

cqugy3e&rust&bguiz&"What you have described is very C-ish/ C++-ish, 
and I think Rust might do well to support implicit headers like this as a feature of the compiler. 

This might even be possible without generating or distributing header files. 

For example, one implementation could be for when each crate is compiled, 
the collective public interface exposed for the entire crate is concatenated and hashed. 
The hash is stored within the crate. 
When a crate is compiled and linked against other crates (dependencies), 
these hashes of their dependent traits are also stored in the compiled crate. 

A developer edits the sources of a crate, and recompiles it.
This requires its dependencies to **maybe** also get recompiled. 
The compiler/ linker decides whether this is necessary, 
based on a simple equality check
comparing the previously stored hashes
to the hashes of the dependencies recomputed now.

Since computing these hashes for every dependent crate 
is going to be much cheaper than re-compiling every dependent crate,
this approach should speed up compilation times of large projects.

I am not sure about this though - it is just an idea -
sounds great in theory,
but I am not sure if something like this would be practical to implement.

A bodyweight-routine should have progression exercises in it.  So when you could do 3 sets of 8-12reps of an exercise, you move onto the next exercise.  So over the weeks and months, you'll be doing the ""same"" routine but the exercises change and increase in difficulty to match up to your strength increases.

* Without further ~~adieu~~ ado, I present to you this subreddits routine which is perfect for beginners or even intermediates new to bodyweight fitness: http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine

cqugy6w&videos&oaknutjohn&"I guess poor ethnic minorities is what I was looking for. But as for the rest of your points I have to sincerely ask if you understand the context in which I was talking about them. 

I was talking about the way reactionary people talk about a drug ""culture"", ""culture of poverty"", etc to talk about ethnic minorities. You can see how clumsy it gets without a short descriptors like ""people of color"" and ""ethnic minorities."" But like I said I'm not generally trying to group them together and blur any distinction, but in this case the one thing they DO have in common is the way they are talked about by reactionaries. Like I said, I understand and agree with your point in general, but in this instance I think you are reaching and either misunderstanding or trying to be offended. "

I think the ones that use a critical thinking perspective towards research are the strongest. Perhaps I'd move on to Whole, Fat Chance, What to Eat, and Food Rules after those original ones. :) if you have Netflix, watch Fed Up and Forks Over Knives.

cqugy9g&movies&EvilPettingZoo_&"Without giving anything away, you literally see a person emotionally crumble before your very eyes. The lead actor was 16 when the film was made (from what I know) and by the end of it you see him age 30 years. The film was shot chronologically, so you see him slowly deteriorate scene after scene. At the end, you are just as exhausted and distraught as he is. The film is a journey that you go along with, and you're the passenger in this boy's nightmare. Shooting the film was so stressful that the actor was pulling his hair out towards the end of production. After it wrapped and he went back to school, his hair was white from all the stress.

Also, live ammunition was used in the movie. There are moments where live rounds are whizzing just inches past the boy's head, all for the sake of completing a scene for a sense of realism. But it worked - the film was noted as being so realistic that soldiers who lived the real days commended Elem Klimov. Here's a quote from wiki said by a German soldier after one of its screenings: *""I was a soldier of the Wehrmacht; moreover, an officer of the Wehrmacht. I traveled through all of Poland and Belarus, finally reaching Ukraine. I will testify: everything that is told in this film is the truth. And the most frightening and shameful thing for me is that this film will be seen by my children and grandchildren.""*

It really is a film that should be viewed just once in a lifetime. You discover the true nature of the human being and what it's capable of. You learn more about yourself and the reason behind why these films are made. For being Elem Klimov's final film, he went out with an absolute bang and finished his legacy with one of the most devastating films of all time."

The transmogrifier or whatever COULD be really cool, but it doesn't seem like you can interact much with the stuff it creates. The fireworks are ok... no complaints there really.

My favorite maps are the ones where you can break or manipulate a shit ton of small things. Kripp called out the gems as being among the best, and he's definitely right there. Overall, I'd rank Stormwind the highest, even with the griffin nerf.

If you want organic/local food boxes you can check out body fuel organics, you can pay a fee and get variety. Google them. 

There's also a program called good food box, similar to weekly boxes of food at body fuel, but they're at a cost and highly recommended by those who use it. 

The farmers market is in full swing now. Wednesday and Saturday mornings downtown. 

There's also Costco, and for a membership you can get deals at times. 

The real Canadian wholesale club on 4th and has decent deals too.

cqugyex&trees&dovaogedy&"You may be a libertarian, but honestly, who is your candidate in this election? Rand Paul? Yeah, how's that whole ""reduce the military budget"" thing going for him now that he's actually trying to get primary voters and donors? Also, he's got so many issues where his views don't line up at all with the traditional libertarian view. Abortion? It seems to me like a libertarian should be fine with abortion, since it's a private medical decision... and yet Rand Paul has consistently voted against abortion rights. That, to me, seems to say that Rand Paul is only against government intervention in the lives of private citizens when it's something that involves him. That kind of 'picking and choosing' is dangerous. 

On the other hand, Bernie Sanders may have some very socialist positions (which I personally love), but he also has some points that are universal. The biggest one is getting money out of politics. And the thing with getting money out of politics, is that if that happens, you'll have more of a voice in the political system to advocate for the things you want to advocate for, be that more government or less. What good does it do for you to say ""I won't vote for the socialist"" when all your other choices are crony capitalists? On the other hand, if you vote for the socialist now and he actually accomplishes his goal of getting money out of politics, you'll have more of a voice to vote for the libertarian policies you want to see. 

At a certain level, supporting Bernie Sanders really only needs to come down to one question: Do you want to have more influence over your government, or do you want Wall Street to have more influence over your government? If the answer is that you want to hold that influence (the way, I believe, the Founding Fathers meant it to be), then you ought to vote for Bernie. "

cqugyfi&nfl&HereComesJustice&WHAT IF THEY DON'T DRAFT MARIOTA
cqugyfj&ChristianOccultism&RCR917&I would dare say the best answer I can give to this question is simply that the physical world was made for us.  The spiritual world is one in which great, enrapturing pleasure, beyond the ken of physical sensation, can be felt, as well as a terrible emptiness that is equally unknowable.  But, in between those two places there is a lot of nothingness.  Using the Bible as an example, you hear of the glory of Heaven and the fires of Hades, but nothing else.  Here, in the physical world, there is a chance to experience a broad range of sensations, emotions, and situations that help to shape and mould who we are and what we become in this life, and in my belief, beyond.  In this world we are forced to learn, to cope, and to mature in one way or another.  I look at the physical world much like one would a finishing school.

cqugygh&palemoon&BigDaddyTug&"Why am I using Palemoon?

1) Australis Sucks. Period. If I wanted to run Chrome, I would download and install Chrome. (Classic Theme Restorer fixes this in FF and Waterfox) (Not a issue in Palemoon)

2) The entire Tabs on Top and Bottom issue. I am unsure when Firefox started putting the tabs in different spots (Between Firefox 3 and 4 versions, I think). I like my Tabs on Bottom. (Again Classic Theme Restorer fixes this in Firefox/Waterfox) (Not a issue in Palemoon as the setting is baked in like it used to be in FF)

3) Static ""Find"" Bar. Newer versions of Firefox load the Find Bar per window and not static across all windows, and is available even on restart. (Palemoon leaves this feature alone and I am grateful)

4)Status Bar removal in Firefox. (Status-4-Evar addon helps here in FF and Waterfox) (Palemoon has this baked in and all you need to do is config it a bit thru the Status Bar Options and the Customize function) When I used to have Dial up and then Hughesnet Satellite, the progress bar and status bars actually helped confirm page hangs and connection issues. When they removed this, it pissed me off pretty bad. ""Transferring data from....."" (Also I want to add, that this can be used as a redirect indicator for web pages, on slower internet, if you watch the status bar, you can clearly see redirects)

5) Insane Memory consumption in Firefox. To the tune of gigs of ram used. Partially due to having to use addons to fix functionality that Firefox seen fit to remove. (Palemoon kicks FF and WF butt in this area.)

6) Mozilla's attitude of its never their fault that memory consumption is so high, and that everyone loves Australis. So they turn a deaf ear to the user base. And of coarse there are all the Fan Boys that get up in arms about it all.

Many of the worst changes happened to Firefox between Versions 4 and 5. When they introduced Australis and fast track updates it went down hill. 

I currently am on Palemoon x64 25.3.2 have addons Adblock Plus 2.6.6,Download Helper 4.9.24, Free Download Manager Plugin 1.6.0.1, Memory Restart 1.18 and Reddit Enhancement Suite 4.5.0.2 and a Theme called Moonfox 3 1.0.1 installed.

My memory is HALF what it is in Firefox and Waterfox. I sit now with 8 open tab (on the bottom of coarse) and Memory Restart reports 750 MB of ram, Task Manager in Windows reports right at 700 Mb. In Firefox and Waterfox it would be over 1000 MB. 

I am tired of Firefox brushing off its memory issues on ""You need to upgrade your machine with more ram"" or ""Disable Addons"" when we all know its with the Core of Firefox itself. If a Core 2 Quad 2.4 Intel with 4 gigs of Ram running Win 7 x64 can run games like WOW (Which uses less ram at times then Firefox) decently, then a Browser should be chump change.

Here is my Layout of how Firefox should be, using Palemoon. I use this layout on all machines, cross platform and on customers machines I fix. Palemoon makes it easier to do.

A real ""stan"" in the kpop world would be called a 사생팬 (sasaeng fan) which are mostly underaged girls who actually follow their idols everywhere and act like deranged stalkers (if you look it up you'll find a whole lot of disturbing things on the issue).

As for Big Bang in particular, you have to understand that Big Bang is one of the most popular kpop group (a good proportion of kpop fans first discovered the genre through one of their songs), and they haven't released anything (not counting individual releases) since 3 years ago, which is an eternity in kpop years.

Plus the members are quite old now for a kpop group and it is nearing the time for them to get enlisted in the army. So basically the fans had started to accept the fact that they may not release any new material before going into the army when ""surprise!"" YG announced their comeback out of nowhere, and it turns out they are going to be promoting for the next 5 months, and then release another album in september.

Gay people are not trying to ""impose"" their beliefs on bakers, they're simply asking for a wedding cake and to not get hassled over having two female or two male figures on the top of the cake. Meanwhile religious zealots actually ARE trying to impose their beliefs on other people by holding other people to their own moral code. That's ridiculous; there is absolutely no relevance in business exchanges between businesses and customers for closely held beliefs. Baking a cake for someone doesn't mean you endorse gay marriage or will go to hell for it.

cqugyir&whowouldwin&famguy2101&well it that case it's a ridiculously unfair match-up, if Aang cant even fight then what's the point?
cqugyis&AskReddit&chipbloch&"Okay, let's do a quick rundown of this.

First, we need to make a distinction between the two kinds of law in the Bible. There's the Moral Law, which is found mostly in the Ten Commandments, and the Ceremonial Law, which is found mostly in the Book of Leviticus. The Moral Law focused on things that were sinful and went against God, while the Ceremonial Law was designed to set the Israelites apart from the rest of the pagan world and mark them as the people from whom the Messiah would come. 

The Moral Law is made up of things like don't kill, don't steal, love your enemies, and don't commit sexual immorality (in any form). The Ceremonial Law has a lot to do with practices that pagan cultures used in improper ways, such as the command against tattoos (Lev. 19:28). Tattoos themselves are not inherently sinful, but they were used in pagan worship rituals, so God forbidding the Israelites from getting them was an attempt to set them apart. 

When Jesus lived, died, and rose again, the Ceremonial Law became defunct. The Israelites no longer needed to be set apart, so the Ceremonial Law was now unnecessary, just like how you don't need to hang up posters for a concert after the concert is over. 

Since the Moral Law was created to make people aware of their sin, it still applies, and this is why murder, theft, and sexual immorality are still forbidden by the Bible. The Ceremonial Law no longer applies, which is why, in Acts chapter 10, God commands Peter that all animals are now considered clean. In various places throughout the New Testament, the disciples and Apostles tell people that they no longer need to follow the Ceremonial Law. 

Now, there's overlap between the Ceremonial and the Moral Laws. In both the Old Testament and New Testament, homosexuality is mentioned as sinful (Lev. 18:22, 1st Cor. 6:9-10), so homosexuality is clearly condemned under the Moral Law. Because the Ceremonial Law is defunct, Christians are no longer required to punish the sinful acts, but the acts themselves remain sinful. 

For another example, consider the adulterous woman in John 8. Jesus tells her that her actions are sinful, but prevents the crowd from carrying out Old Testament, Ceremonial Law judgement on her. The act is still sinful, but the judgement is no longer required. 

The reason Christians are able to eat bacon-wrapped scallops dipped in cheese is because there was never anything sinful about the act, the commandment against it was merely to separate the Israelites from pagan cultures around them. 

TL;DR: Two kinds of law in the OT, Moral and Ceremonial. Moral is sinful, Ceremonial is not. Homosexual activity is part of moral law, dietary restrictions are not. "

cqugyix&Texans&dseals&/u/deephousebeing pls respond! Baby come back!
cqugyiy&Planetside&SnoopinGrouper&"First off, lately Ive mostly been using my lightning, now that I finished the auraxium i almost exclusively run stealth AP.  Ive also used the vanguard quite a bit solo, with the ap cannon and canister.

I like the AP lightning so much cause its one of the few roles that can let one man change a battlefield.  Stealth lets you take on enemy MBTs and deployed sunderers before they can react, even in large fights.  Tanks in this game win and lose fights before they start, and half the fun is choosing fights that you know you can win, and baiting superior enemies into screwing up.  The lightning is the underdog in a lot of situations, but its also capable of a lot more than people realize, especially fully certed.

While I like the vanguard, its just too damn slow.  You run out of av targets in an area and you have to abandon the damn thing or drive 10 minutes.  The cannister helps a bit if Im solo, since i can engage infantry and annhilate the inevitable vulcans any armor lures in, but it still lacks the wider range of tactics and manuverability of the lightning.

1 tip i have for driving is to almost never stop and mostly move in 3rd person.  This gives you much better awareness and a slightly higher viewpoint, which helps you choose engagements and avoid harm much more effectively.  

Next tip is to grab a rival chassis for your lightning.  This alone can let you win most close range engagements with other lightnings and harrassers, since you have so much more freedom to both get behind enemys and face them with strong front armor.  Maxed it doubles the lightnings turn rate from the worst to second best.

Believe it or not, I work with a person who is absolutely nasty for no reason, in front of others. That person is not a TV character and everyone that knows the person has zero idea what triggers it or motivates it. That person does actually meet all of the known designators for a sociopath.

And then, to my sister's horror, he announced her weight to the *entire* class and made a really rude comment about her weight.

Scary Webspinner stories aside though, I haven't gotten to play the deck yet, but I can definitely see how there's a lot going for it right now.

cqugyrv&leagueoflegends&flicker486&In the patch that she was nerfed they also added Cinderhulk, buffed Urgot, and buffed Righteous Glory. And of course around this time Hecarim was gaining popularity. Teams started wanting more overtime damage rather than single target burst. Watch SKT vs Jin Air on what I think was the first 5.5 patch where SKT outclassed them in picks and bans where GBM picked Liss and SKT had all tanks and had a more scaling team-fight focused comp. And then everyone copied them, Vlad gained a lot of popularity because of consistent damage/takiness/good team fighting. And then Vlad became the new flex pick for mid and top. So Liss is still played but outclassed in the current tank meta to other picks.

cqugyw0&mew&AmIRhino&"On first listen I was a bit disappointed. After several listens I grew to love the whole thing. 

I think my favorite song on the album would have to be ""Making Friends"". 

It's really hard to say where I would rank it compared to their other albums since I've had years to listen to those. Though I think No More Stories... will likely always be my favorite and And The Glass Handed Kites will mostly likely always be my 2nd favorite. 

The only thing that I am still disappointed about is that ""Bamse"" and ""Boy"" are not on the album. Hopefully they do decide to record and release them in the future. Also, I'm curious what came of the song that was briefly featured in the Sensory Spaces promo. "

cqugyxd&PurplePillDebate&NamasteInBed&"What about the relationship element makes the system break? Who breaks it? And have all the relationship situations ended where you're unable to be friends any more 100%? I am genuinely curious because I cannot imagine doing this, especially frequently, and avoiding issues of crash and burn. 

That said, I am thinking as someone without too many external to my city networks. One thing you did say though that I think helps your system and may influence the relative success of this whole lifestyle is the geography thing. You're not really full-time friends with the people who live in different cities, let alone going to be in a situation where relationshiping seems viable in the traditional sense. Now don't take my full-time comment to mean the friendships are inferior or less, so to speak. You may be dear friends with these people, talk a lot online, and be just like best friends when you do happen to be in person together, but I think those kinds of friendships are easier to maintain, less close, and less enticing for people in some ways than ones that are daily, in person, and very much a part of your life routine."

A QT doesn't have to be fancy, either. Mine is an ugly cheap 5g I keep in my closet. I throw some plants in and a seeded filter that I keep running in my main tank, and the cheap heater I also keep in my closet while I fill it up. When I'm done, I drain it and put everything away again. "

Marriage should have *something* that distinguishes it from an unmarried couple who lives together. I think that something should be additional relationship security by discouraging both partners from leaving.

For this specific scenario, I would say she made a bad decision when she agreed to marry him. People would definitely have to take considering whether or not to marry someone a lot more seriously if leaving had consequences."

cqugyz3&pkmntcg&Rakkis157&"/u/Brassrain did something similar using Ursaring and Noivern, and I followed with Ursaring + Glaciate Kyurem. That was more than 3 months ago. I've had my eyes set on this ever since Roaring Skies' Unfezant got leaked. Took them long enough.

Anyways, this is a very disruptable strategy with many parts, so you have to literally build your deck to be both explosive with tons of item draw and hyper defensive with Jamming Nets/Head Ringers. Also plenty of switches to make sure Mew is active. This strategy requires that you hit them in that small window of time when their EXs have yet to charge up, and Mr.Mime is *hopefully* not yet on the bench. 

Of all the decks I've built, this is the king of glass cannons.

Kyurem is in theory better than Spinda, because it provides you with a second attack that has the potential to wreck even if they play the Mime, and Glaciate totals up to 110 damage to everything. We all know what will be at 110 Hp after the set hits."

cqugz14&AskReddit&SubtleTypos&"A bit late to the party, but I had to chime in on this one. 

High school, junior year. Most of us were around 16, some had been peaking into 17. In my APUSH class, our teacher had been making some really sexist remarks. I had only been half listening so I can't really tell you then verbatim, but it essentially led to one of my girl classmates telling him, ""If you were my age, I'd slap you so hard right now.""

Almost immediately, as if he had been waiting to say it for a long time, he nonchalantly replied back,

""If I was your age, I'd be on top of you in the back of my truck right now.""

The worst part is that he still works there. The school can't bring itself to fire him, and he's gotten away with so much shit like this. "

cqugz2h&Dogtraining&CritFailingLife&"I think part of the difference for me in working with my own project dog versus working with a client's dog or a shelter dog is the same as with babies - when it's someone else's, it's adorable and manageable and then you can go home and recharge for next time. When it's your own pup, you never get a step back to recharge, so you're constantly aware of it (and for the more annoying/stressful problems, it's constantly draining your reserves). Practicing not jumping on me for an hour with someone else's dog, I can mentally think, ok, this is really annoying, but in an hour, I can have personal space again and stop being punched in the breasts. When it's your own dog, there isn't really a break from it until you've successfully gotten pretty reliable on the issue at hand...and I think a lot of us tend to gravitate towards the pups with plenty of issues at hand because they need us in a way easy dogs don't. 
  
Pair that with being our own worst critics and there not being an owner to make your effort feel appreciated since all you have is you and you start to feel like a failure. 
  
My back is out and my recent rescue who's large and still working on not jumping on me is really putting my patience and pain tolerance to the test this week. If she were a dog I was professionally involved with, I'd be able to reschedule for a week when I wasn't broken, but since she's my baby, here we are. However, in a few years when we've worked out most of her issues and mostly only the awesome aspects are left, she'll still be my dog and with me all the time and that will be the amazing parts I get with her now, but without the constant work and frustration, so it's very, very definitely worth it. It can just sure be a hell of a time getting to the other side sometimes.
  
Keep going, I bet you're doing a fantastic job! Progress is progress whether it's the same as the progress others are making or not. Every pup and human and pairing moves at a different speed and that's ok. We're all starting from different places and learning different things from it. You and your pup are both learning from the process, you're just too close to it to see it. "

Still an imbalanced power dynamic, with some pretty gross implications, and you hear something pretty close to a ""plantation mentality"" slip out on occasion. I think it was near the end of Spurs-Clippers game 5, there was a shot of (maybe) Tim Duncan standing on the sideline in front of Peter Holt. One of the commentators referred to him as ""Standing by his owner.""

c is and always be exactly 299792458 metres per second. 

Also this EmDrive is all about group-velocity.  Not *velocity*, but group-velocity. Group velocity **does not** mean that every individual particle is moving faster than the speed of light but 2 **different** photons from the same source can reach a detector where the impact of 2 **different** photon's would be faster than the movement of a photon starting from detector A and move to B. 

Imagine you have 2 blue cars. Each car moves at the same speed 20 km/h but in a 90 degree angle. Both cars never drove faster than 20 km/h but after a 100 km the distance between car A and B would be bigger than a car would drive from A to B.

Group velocity means that you are not measuring one and the same photon just 2 different photons. "
cqugz64&politics&joeyramoney&I was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America for about a half decade, and that's not the type of thing that anyone would talk about as an actual possibility because there's no practical means to abolish private property. I mean, you get lots of people on the Left and Far Left who talk about abolition of capitalism and the like as this abstract eventual step that follows social democracy through some undefined process, but that's really little more than bluster. If you meet someone who will say stuff like private property needs to be abolished, you can typically ask a few basic follow-up questions to realize that they only mean this in a metaphorical, abstract sense and have no means to put this goal into practice. Socialism means a lot of different things to different people (as does capitalism), but for the most part, western socialists typically use the term to refer to a more diligent approach to social democratic institutions in the pursuit of a more egalitarian society that is less influenced by capitalism.

cqugza6&eldertrees&battinheavy&"Yes, as strange as it may seem, there are several compounds in cannabis which are well known to cause vasoconstriction. No idea of their synergy.

(Not trying to knock HydroTHC's response, but sources like that are convoluted at best when making their case for a particular 'benefit' of cannabis. See my response to his with an explanation of the study they cite and more journal resources.)

I'm not sure what kind of injury you had or what you can do about the pain when this happens. The most I can recommend is OTC pain medications, specifically naproxen for joint pain. I'd take a low dose of ibuprofen for quicker relief and then a normal dose of naproxen as it takes longer to kick in.

I would stay away from the opiate pain relievers, especially if you are going to smoke. You don't want to combine the depressant effects of narcotic pain relievers and cannabis. A lot of people also struggle with rapid addiction to this class. Those things aside, opiates work by blocking the reception of pain and don't target the problematic areas like an NSAID would. Believe it or not, you may experience very good relief if you take naproxen alone before you smoke.

Obviously abstaining from tobacco is always a good thing.

Was this a kind of injury you can exercise or stretch in any way? Not only will moving those joints around and keeping them active will help your body to ""realize their importance"" and work to keep them healthy, but stretching them and allowing that synovial fluid to shift could provide you with very good relief in the short-term.

Hope that helps...let me know if you have any other questions."

cqugzdf&hockey&Aeea&"We will never replace Zett or Dats, just like we haven't ever replaced Lids or Rafalski.  They will be rotated out and the likes of Nyquist, Tatar, and Sheahan will be moved up.  We do what every team does, and pray to the hockey gods that we hit gold again in a prospect.  However, I don't think it is coincidence that Detroit has made such good selections in the past.  
It is a numbers game, and you are looking for the kids with the most raw hockey talent mixed with determination/work ethic.  Detroit obviously has the resources and connections to land such players.  It doesn't always work out, but it has for at least the last 24 years.  I think losing Jim Nill (and his possy) hurt a bit, but that won't exactly shine through for a few years.  
Babs said it best when he stated Detroit ""wins too much.""  Can't get good picks if you aren't losing.  *Insert Oilers joke*.  
I like the Red Wings roster, and I will still like it when Zetterberg, Datsyuk, and Kronwall depart.  I like that the Red Wings are a TEAM, and depend less on individual talent.  You can't tell me these kids don't play their fucking hearts out.  I can't even imagine being first in line at the draft.  Never crossed my mind as a possibility, and I like that too."

cqugzdu&Norway&Shasefine&"Well; no one really speaks Norwegian. Only Norwegians do, and that's why we all learn English from an early age.

This is easy, CM. 
You know the city you will live in (assuming you are actually decided to move), which means you have a defined number of schools to apply for a position as an English teacher. Check with all of the ones, both private and public, within a certain radius of where you expect to live. I'm assuming your BF knows where he wants to move to.. Do that right now. Before you leave.
This will give you an approximation of how difficult it will be to get a job. Could be that a school right next to where you want to live is in need of your skills, or not. No way to tell unless you look for a position. Keep in mind that a lot of schools do not advertise available positions. Could be a person going on maternity/paternity leave in x months coincides with you coming to Norway, in which case you could be wanted as a sub. As a sub you can get the experience with working in the Norwegian school system which in turn will give you an advantage when applying for a permanent position. 

Generally Americans and Norwegians go well together, unless you are one of those AMERICANS. The ones we have seen on Springer or smth.. :)

If you expect something of Norway, Norway won't really live up to what you expect. That's kind of the best thing with going somewhere foreign. Keeping an open mind and thinking that ppl are generally helpful and nice would be a good start. I expect your BF will prep you properly, so what I can add is that I have yet to encounter a country that can't be a good place to live. Situations may happen when you are baffled, but that is just the charm of cultural differences :)

Salary you can expect as a teacher should be NOK 350'-450' depending on your qualifications, and if they are applicable to the Norwegian system. 

The biggest piece of advice, as for moving to any country, commit to the move. Commit to starting afresh. You are a new addition to a new environment. You have to learn what it can give you, and what you can give back. Participate, be active, look for events, travel within the city, and be American. Be the person initiating contact. Norwegians are, it seems when I see how we are perceived, a convoluted mass of individuals. This is not true; it just takes a bit longer to pierce the shell of trust. Be the person piercing the shell :)

In simple terms, all the clients play in the future and the server retroactively decides how the game plays out.

This has the massive benefit of responsive controls but causes some obvious issues. The most easily apparent way to see this in action is when you're jump-peeking anything. Often times you'll die AFTER you've hit the ground, even when you can't even see your opponents. Similarly if you manage to maneuver yourself around a corner and then die anyway. This is because the server is saying ""hey, that guy shot you"" and, because the server is always right, your client ""rewinds"" and kills you.

cqugzgw&NationalSocialism&NotEqual15&"I didn't read the link, but I do know of the real reasons for the war on Germany. Hitler and the Nazis came to power and really made some big changes which would have made the whole world look. Economy was thriving after just 4 years.... When Hitler changed the Currency of Germany and made it to represent actual labor, I think that scared the bankers and governments of England and the USA. 
But the big thing was the Barter system. Germany used a barter system to trade with about 25 mostly poor countries.  A barter system is trading resources/ equipment directly, no money involved. This was seen as a dangerous development for the bankers in London and New York.  Dangerous for the governments of banker countries like England and the USA. If countries were trading by barter then that means they wouldn't have to borrow money to import the things they needed. That meant that countries could trade without money, interests, debt, and bankers.  This is the real reason Germany had to be destroyed; just imagine if that barter system caught on, would there be a big international banking system today? Would their be a IMF?  "

**From the mods over there:** ""Links to your subreddit will still be removed by us for at least the time being. And while you promote piracy and continue to sit back while members of your community brigade us, encourage drama and distort our actions that will be the status quo.""


**My response:**

""Your community"". It's our community. They were your community first.
I'm not clear on how we are still promoting piracy either. Even if we were, it'd require you, as mods, to be on our sub reading these things, which is funny considering you delete all mention of us. And as far as sitting back while members of my community do anything...well, that's the point isn't it? You can't seriously expect me to crack down on users in my sub complaining about your sub?
The level in which you have taken an unpaid, volunteer position to facilitate a conversation about a fictional book is absolutely unbelievable.

Is it an age thing?  Is there a specific age demographic of the guys on Reddit who will never admit to any guy on guy sex?  Or is it that the majority of guys who really do consider themselves straight and who occasionally will get with another guy simply don't read this Reddit?  Or maybe the subject is too taboo to discuss, even in the relatively anonymous confines of Reddit and guys don't know how to use throwaway account names?

If they've got that covered, and they have enough money to buy a bit of week and some smokes, a lot of folks are happy. This idea that they will still be motivated to go out and find work because the basic income won't be enough, is wrong on two levels. 1) If it's not enough, then what's the point. 2) There are people who would rather not work, and not just because they are lazy.

cqugzqu&alaskapackrafting&YepYepYepYepYepUhHuh&"This trip begins at the Upper Chena Dome trailhead (Mile 50.8 CHSR). Begin by hiking up the Chena Dome trail until you gain the ridge. After about 2 miles take a right to head down a North ridge into the Olympica creek drainage. 

Olympia creek is a very small creek that may be runnable at high water, but there are many log jams. It is easier to put in at the confluence of Olympia creek and the West Fork of the Chena. 

As of last year, the West Fork had a 2-3 impassable log jams on it. These required some bushwacking to get around. 

Continue along the river until it meets up with CHSR at any of the takeouts."

But depending on the problem, pre-training may be unnecessary anyway. Just build a deep autoencoder with ReLUs and possibly dropout and you should be able to train that end-to-end in many cases."

Given these factors, we feel that we cannot in good faith recognize the results of this referendum and as such shall continue to regard Burma as illegally occupied territory.

cqugzt2&relationships&seeashbashrun&"People with a locus of control outside of themselves tend to struggle with relationships, mood disorders, and success. The main problem is him mistreating you, but it's a secondary symptom to him refusing responsibility for anything. 

For example, a common origin for depression is the incidence of 'learned helplessness', meaning a person feels helpless to change or impact things. 

Even if he didn't target you, refusal to consider responsibility for personal events is a red flag. It is something that should be worked on and tackled, the same as a bad temper or mood swings. Everyone struggles with it from time to time, but the ability to recognize your role in your life is pivotal to healthy relationships.

Add to that his behavior towards you, he has a major problem and is mistreating you over it. If he is willing to get therapy and actually work on it, he might improve and learn to accept responsibility. But even if he does (which is unlikely, due to the nature of the problem), he has already demonstrated that he's okay using you as his verbal punching bag. Is that okay with you?"

cqugzv6&WritingPrompts&CouldaBeen_TheBest&"The Count focused very intently on his apparently new hire. He palmed her some gold and I saw the word ""Eliminate."" drift past her ear. The Elf nodded in understanding and stood, donning her black mask and hood once more. The vision ended abruptly, as the count snapped his attention towards us. He probably hadn't actually seen us, but likely sensed the magic of the scrying. My face grew pale as all the pieces of the puzzle fell into place. It should have been obvious that the Count knew what his daughter had planned. But to resort to bold faced murder? It was unlike him to keep things quiet like this. It would have been a public execution normally. Or at the very least he would have been sent to the prisons for the rest of his life.

Sal and I stared at each other for a moment as reality began to warp back to its usual form. ""Hell, Vosk, you're in it deep now."" She said to me with her palm pressed to her forehead. I sat there, dumbstruck. The count must have given the order to have me killed if I investigated. Something here still didn't add up and it bothered me. I didn't know the man very personally, but this was unlike him. One thing was apparent to me though, I had to go underground, and fast, if I was going to survive. ""Thanks Sal, if I get out of this with my head intact, I owe you a drink."" I said breathlessly as I walked out the door.

The sun was lower in the sky now, long shadows draped the back streets and filled me with dread. Each one seemed to take the shape of an assassin in waiting. I remembered Victorias seer stone was still resting in my pocket. I gripped it in my palm and focused on it. Her face was projected into my mind and she spoke quickly, in a low hushed tone. ""What is it? I'm busy."" I chose my words carefully and sent them through the Aether to her. My very thoughts were projected outward, leaving my mind. ""Your father had Lyre killed. And now he's after my life.""

""My god... VOSK BEHIND YOU!"" Her voice echoed in my mind and my body reacted out of instinct. I ducked the sword swing and spun quickly, my sight refocused quickly and the assassin stood before me. ""Verrry good vor a human. I'm impressed vith your skill."" That voice cut like a blade through the air. The thick northerner accent was uncommon around these parts. She must have traveled a very long way to get here. And she must have been paid well for it too. ""Let us see 'ow you handle this!"" She jabbed her rapier forward with a sudden violence. The tip of the blade dug into the chain mail lining my coat, just barely piercing my skin. The flesh wound wasn't enough to stop me, and in an instant I was upon her, knocking the blade out of her hand and drawing my dagger to my open palm in the same instant. I slam her into the nearest wall and hold her there with my forearm. She wasn't expecting me to be able to shrug off her blow, I'm sure not many had in the past, either. I drew in face to face, and stared her down. ""Answers, now!"""

cqugzw6&atheism&oneupmanshipwreck&"/u/mtm028 can jump in here if my atheistic understanding of the bible is in error...

That all sex outside marriage is immoral according to Christian theology is not in question here I believe.

It is established in Corinthians 7:2 and Matthew 19:4–6, Mark 10:6-9 among other places that marriage is a man and woman and in 1 Corinthians 6:9-11,  Romans 1:24-27 and other passages that homosexuality is immoral.

It seems to take a different tack from some churches such as the Anglican that homosexuality itself isn't immoral, only homosexual activity.

There is one that is more open to debate, Matthew 19:11-12, which discusses men who are eunuchs since birth who are not to marry.  Talmudic scholars treat the same reference as being about gay men. "

cqugzw8&Diablo3Barbarians&DraaxxTV&"I would drop furious charge for War Cry (Impunity) for the added toughness. I'd also put an Amethyst in your helm. Work on getting your gems leveled up by doing 1, 11, 21 GRifts. Taeguk would probably be my first priority as it increases your damage for each level and your toughness once you get it to 25. I would go bane of the trapped instead of toxin but only once it is rank 25 which you should level next. You should also mess with your passive/skills to balance survivability with damage and fury gen. I would craft War of the Dead until you get an ancient legendary one and use weapon master passive instead of Animosity. You could also run Superstition instead of Animosity and use the Wind Shear rune on whirlwind. Just mess around with it in a lower torment level and see what ""feels"" good. With those changes you should be able to do T4 no problem. 

I would suggest working towards 6pc Wrath of Waste (I went from T3 to T6 just by getting the last piece I needed to complete the set). Finding an ancient legendary 2h weapon would really help you out too but make sure to gamble for wrath pieces as its the biggest upgrade. You do get to a point where damage trumps survivability and you can just ww/sprint through the entire map and collect loot.

Hope that helps."

For me, the big four pieces are the PGF, the Sierra Sounds, the Cripplefoot tracks and the Skookum body cast. They all corroborate each other as well as a thousand other footprint casts and a hundred thousand witness testimonies. "

cqugzy0&explainlikeimfive&AndyBatcountry&"Basically the UN

There is an International Court of Justice that is (currently) set up in the Hague (Netherlands)

Part of being a member nation of the UN is that you agree to adhere to international justice, which includes allowing anyone accused of war crimes to be tried at the Hague

The judges are elected (from a list of suitable nominees) by the General Assembly and Security Council

They are basically ""tracked down"" though by whoever is closest. The UN will vote, pass a resolution and then assign people from whichever country is most suitable (usually the country where the person lives) to track them down and ""bring them to justice""

That's how it works in theory anyway

In practice is mainly just a massive circle-jerk "

cqugzys&dwarffortress&esport5000&"Last night I started a new fortress, on a volcano in the middle of a mountain range. I was worried because there was nowhere I could build a farm plot except on a few sand tiles outside, for which I had no seeds. So I began digging, hoping to reach the caverns before all of my dwarves died of thirst (not a large worry, as I had plenty of stockpiled drink brought with me) and my sheep starved.

Plenty of z-levels later, I reached it. Now I have an interesting fortress setup with my magma workshops in the volcano on the top level (I like to build floors in the caldera over the top layer of magma to avoid having to actually pump the magma and possibly lose a miner in the process), accompanied by my depot and barracks, and, deep below, my dormitories and hospital and general workshop lie right above the caverns, which I sealed off.

It's one of the most interesting fortresses I've designed so far, as nothing I've made has been entirely insular like this--with no plants or trees on the surface, I don't have to go out there for anything other than occasionally mining some ore which I haven't yet found below the surface. I'm really happy with the results so far: about 70 citizens, plenty of food and drink, ☼engravings☼ out the wazoo (I got a high master engraver in the first migrant wave), and a fledgling textile industry."

cqugzzr&AskReddit&SuspiciousPointer&"Macs are beautiful, powerful, easy-to-use machines. Apple idiot-proofs them so well they're almost impossible to break (or work on, if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to access the system's internal workings).

**Apple supplies all the software you need:**

* iWork 2014, with all those confusing, unnecessary features (like formatting options-who needs those?) removed for ease of use
* App Store, the easiest way to give Apple even more of your money
* iPhoto, now with automated, mandatory photo scanning for face recognition and extra lag
* iTunes, a powerful tool for mismanaging content on your iDevice. Will only delete all your music if you sync to the wrong computer.

 * Probably.

 * Coming never: the ability to upload photos to your iPhone or iPad!

**On a Mac, you need never worry about viruses…**

Those in the wild are detected and blocked, while Apple provides you with the latest developments in malware, whether you like it or not.

The new ""Download-Gigabytes-Of-Updates-While-You're-Not-Looking"" function makes staying up-to-date with the latest bugs and ""features"" even easier. Recent updates have included:

* Converting the previously accessible iPhoto Library folder into an entirely new document type, preventing access to your photos through unauthorized applications such as Finder.
* Hiding the Library directory because you're too stupid to be allowed inside.
* Deactivating the ""Quick Look"" feature. Why? To prove we can.
* Uploading unsaved documents to Apple's iCloud without the user's consent

**Apple ~~never~~ usually doesn't charge for new versions of its operating system.**

Yosemite is free, comes with all the features detailed above and only bricks 20% of computers on installation. With more iOS-like features than ever, it is a step in a new direction, toward a future where computers think they're oversized iPads, and Apple has total control.

Apple. Think different, and you're SOL.

Printing a 100 gram object can take hours, though printing time is very dependant on the complexity of the print path.  3D printing is very good for custom work at low volume or for shapes that are impossible with injection molding.

(Mass is a bad metric for comparing cost and time of print but it's close enough to get the point across.  Mass also doesn't give you a good sense of how big the printed object will be because the objects are rarely printed solid.)"

cquh001&DotA2&Nykarien&"One of the admins in the raidcall said that there are no rules to who takes what hero, it was a matter of who clicked first. Then, after I took storm, a teammate of mine started to troll me nonstop because he was mad he didn't get the hero. After that my team backed him up in all chat while telling each other to set me up in team chat like it was a joke. The way the admins dealt with this situation was by giving me two strikes and saying that the person who was mad was a ""regular"" and that theres no way he could possibly be messing with me. This type of attitude towards newcomers really pissed me off. Any newcomers who want a friendly guild should look towards http://www.reddit.com/r/NoobsOfTheAncient"

cquh00c&financialindependence&tturedditor&"It's good that you are researching this now.  Let me be the first to assure you, the new salary will not go as far as you imagine.  It will be a very nice boost but you will not feel wealthy.  Particularly not with three kids and $147K in debt, with minimal retirement savings thus far.  

I would encourage you and wife to read The White Coat Investor.  This may be the best single resource for physicians getting started.  The author also has a blog at whitecoatinvestor.com

Step one is to max out tax deferred retirement accounts, as well as 529 for the three kids and also HSA.  Max out on every tax deferred account you can.  After that, prioritize the following:  

1)  Paying off credit card
2)  Getting rid of student loans 
3)  Saving for a home
4)  Treating your wife to a well deserved (but affordable/modest) car

Read the book I recommended.  I am a physician myself, I make in the mid range of the projected salary for your wife, don't have kids, live in a relatively HCOL area.  Trust me, you need to have a plan in advance and part of that plan should be the realization you are NOT going to be wealthy for a number of years despite the very nice salary.  

If you bite off more than you can chew early on, you will be on the consumption treadmill for a long time just like people making $40K a year.  I have seen people do this, buy too much house and too much car before they even get their first paycheck and they are debt slaves just like the rest.  Do your research now.  "

cquh013&electronic_cigarette&TSpectacular&"Ha! It can be a whole hell of a lot of things. It's sort of a catchall word here in Philly. But it can't take the place of just any word. As an extreme example, you could (in theory, and get mocked for doing so, but just for the sake of illustration) say 'Yo, while you're at the store pick up some of them blueberry jawns. I'm gonna run down to the spot and pick up a couple of them jawns that Ricky sells. That way when we get up to that Fishtown jawn tonight we'll have our own jawns and we can get live. You know them pretty jawns always show up at them warehouse jawns'.

Translated, that would mean 'While you're at the store, pick up a couple of blueberry blunt wraps. I'm going to go down to the weed spot and purchase a couple of bags from Ricky. That way, when we get to the party in Fishtown we'll already have our weed and won't have to figure out who is selling there. That way we can spend our time enjoying ourselves rather than dealing with the hassle of sorting our affairs out while we're at the party. As an added benefit, pretty girls tend to be in attendance at warehouse parties in this particular neighborhood, and hopefully they will choose to indulge in our marijuana and spend time with us.'  
  
You mostly glean understanding of what is meant by 'jawn' in any particular case from context. It would never be used as many times in a row as in my example above, but I suppose it could.  
  
So, if someone saw you sucking on a metal tube or box and exhaling vapor, 'e-jawn' would most certainly be understood to mean 'personal nicotine vaporizer' or 'e-cigarette', but you wouldn't have to use the 'c' word or sound like a giant fucking nerd.  
  
tl;dr: Jawn means jawn. If you can't bang the slang you better ask somebody."

Two women with a penchant for ""violence and perfume"" take revenge on their animal-masked male persecutor. In this contemporary rendering of gothic enchantment, victim becomes aggressor and the familiar becomes the fantastic. Condit reworks popular narrative conventions using black humor, sing-song dialogue, and ironically gruesome images. Constructing a comically grim fairy tale of dreamlike pursuit and sexual violence, she inverts traditional Freudian metaphors to impart a subversive voice to her transgressive heroines: ""I bite at the hand that feeds me."" Possibly in Michigan is a classic tale of psychosexual horror, retold as an irreverent fantasy of the other.""

cquh03g&audiophile&fuimani&"The ""driver diameter"" is the diameter of the driver... That's what moves to produce the sound. That won't tell you much about the sound.

""Magnet"" refers to the material of the permanent magnet in the voice coil - the system that moves the driver. Again, doesn't really mean anything.

""Voice coil"" is the material of the inductor in the voice coil - again, to move the driver, and again, doesn't mean much.

""Frequency response"" refers to the range of frequenies the driver can reliably reproduce. Human hearing ranges between about 20Hz to about 20000Hz in the best cases, so that's more than good enough, but won't tell you much about the sound.

""Maximum power input"" refers to how much power the driver can handle; in this case, 1.6 watts producing a 1KHz tone. This is related to the sensitivity, which is the sound pressure level when provided with 1 milliwatt of power. 98db/mW is about standard for headphones, and won't tell you much about the sound.

""Impedance"" refers to the nominal impedance of the driver, which is the resistance at difference frequenies. 32 ohms is standard for most headphones, and 35 isn't far off. A higher rating will denote a driver that can be cleanly driven easier, but will receiver less power from the amplifier. Don't worry about this rating until you get into really high-end headphones, and even then, just make sure your amp can drive that impedance.

If you want to know how this set sounds, read a -ton- of reviews for it and competing products. Note the descriptions of the sound; that's the only real way to determine what kind of output you'll get."

cquh04g&CompetitiveHS&CredibleExpert&"Now that the last wing is out would you consider adding any of the new card? Solemn Vigil, Blackwing Corrupter, Volcanic Drake, and Nefarian all seem like possibilities in different Dragon Pally archetypes. A more tempo/midrange version of the deck might include Drake, Corrupter, and Vigil with board clears and little minions to trade for huge swing turns. A control deck might use Nefarian, Corrupter, and Solemn Vigil.

I guess what I'm saying is that Corrupter is almost too good not to play in a Dragon deck and Solemn Vigil is very powerful with Chromaggus, Muster, Equality, Consecration, etc. Any thought?"

cquh05a&OutOfTheLoop&aslate&"The report you link to specifically says the majority of deaths were natural causes through drug and alcohol abuse, and neglect rather than brutality. It's been a topic of national debate for some time that the police aren't the right people to be handling mentally ill people after arrest - and I think the police force would be very happy if they had proper mental health services that they could fall back to.

So you've got a steady decrease in the number of deaths in police custody, and we're now down to about 15/year - which is fairly low, but of course should be zero. Oh, and you also have a strong downward trend and people looking into how to change the situation.

You call an average of 30 people a year (of which 8/year through restraint) dying at the hands of police ""notorious""? Shit, I'd hate to hear your views [on the US statistics](http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/deaths-police-custody-united-states#), which seem to be at about 418  homicides a year, with various other causes making up the remaining 269 cases.

cquh05h&fatlogic&dallasuptowner&"I'm inclined to agree with this, I know several people that have had great long term success with Weight Watchers including my sister-in-law who lost a ton of weight on it and kept it off. It's certainly not for everyone and sometimes they backslide (Let's face it, must of us put on some weight every once in a while because of life), the FA acceptance movement calls it yo-yo dieting when it is overweight people, thin people it is just holiday weight or turning 30, or having a kid, stress at work, etc.

I think one of the great things about Weight Watchers is even after you lose the weight they encourage you to come back to meetings as often as you want for free to keep you on track, to support yourself and your fellow members in your new lifestyles which I think is great. I was honestly surprised when a few of my friends that had lost weight on it mentioned that they kept going back to meetings."

cquh05q&explainlikeimfive&afndale&"Here's a simple solution: Say exactly what you mean. So if you see somebody swerving around, don't say ""Wow that dude is driving like a retard"", instead say ""Wow that guy needs to learn how to drive"". Bam, instant political correctness, and you can still be as offensive as anything. You're just being offensive only to the object of your anger, rather than a bunch of mentally disabled people who may very well be excellent drivers.

Another way is to drop irrelevant information. ""Ok, so I was talking to this dude, he's black by the way, and then he told me about Maxwell's Demon, what an interesting conversation!"" Notice that nothing in there is ""offensive"", but the fact that the guy was black has nothing to do with the point of the sentence. By adding that info in, you make it sound like it was interesting that a black guy knows about Maxwell's Demon, not that the Demon itself is interesting. This will also help avoid spreading stereotypes, as well as to help building stereotypes in your own mind, unconsciously."

cquh066&UQHolder&JMB11&"It is an alternate timeline. There are 3 possible endings to Negima. 

Without spoiling it: 
-The ""GREAT"" end was the final chapter, but Akamatsu said in the manga, it was one possible outcome, and it doesn't match up with UQ holder, so it's not the real one.

-The ""GOOD"" Ending was the chapter before that, when everyone is happy and graduated, and the future is uncertain.

-The ""BAD"" ending was the third last chapter.

I've been bummed the whole series thinking it was the ""BAD"" ending, but something recently made me think it was based off the ""GOOD"" ending,which is a lot better.

And yes, I Akamatsu's decisions have been frustrating recently, but I have faith he'll pull it all together at some point. He created Negima. Surely he wouldn't lose his touch so much :P"

Like the size thing with guys, if it functions and isn't profoundly big/small/disfigured, the only one who reaaally cares is you.

Same goes for hair down there. Sure, if I had a preference, I'd go for smooth where it counts with a little fashion fluff up front, but no way in hell am I complaining about a little bush. I think most non-jerky people feel the same."

cquh099&nosleep&registered_lunatic&"Yes, actually.  Deja vu is one of the many consequences.  Sometimes the new reality is just off sync enough for you to notice.   

Death is another.  Think of all of the times that you probably should have died.  Guess what?  You did.  Your consciousness simply slips into a reality where you didn't.  This also explains why we tend to not remember much about our near death experiences.  I imagine that this continues until the realities collapse, and there's no more plausible realities for you to slip to.  

I've come to believe that the passage of time itself is simply us experiencing these slips.  That it's constant; not just an occasional thing.  In string theory there's a concept that time passes via planck scale wormholes constantly pulling matter into a frame.  Wormholes are also believed to connect alternate realities.  So, there's some amount of scientific indication that my theory is the case.  "

1. The only marriages that should be valid -- if we are to protect what is ethically best and most rational for us (as individuals and in society) -- are those between two people who first, out of mutual and true friendship, *aim for virtue* and then, if possible but not necessarily, intend to procreate (for the good of their union *and* the human race). 

2. Correct. ""Immutable facts"" that depend on human nature and that are and have been gradually discovered by reason. 

3. Reproduction is virtuous in the ways described only if ""union in virtue"" keeps its primacy.

cquh0bl&rutgers&TheLazarbeam&"Lol, I live in Campbell right now and all of this is true, but I wouldn't use the word constantly. 

There's a good deal of traffic.

I'm a heavy sleeper but my roommate says he gets woken up by the garbage trucks at 6 AM if we leave the windows open, so then it becomes very hot in our room at night, which I personally think is worse. No AC :( 

Events in Deiner Park happen maybe once a month, in the nice months. They are obnoxious though. I just put in headphones.

Ambulances do come through A LOT, you can watch them go by from the main lounge, but I never thought they were that loud. I'm on the river side though. 

Helicopters come through very infrequently. I've seen probably 4-6 in the 7-8 months I've lived here, and it never shook the room. The whole ordeal lasts about 30 seconds. 

I've never seen the crew guys.

The ROTC pisses me the fuck off. fuck those guys. I get that they get up bright and early, but why exercise right next to the dumpsters behind a random building anyway? Go to Buccleuch Park 2 blocks away.

SIDE NOTE: All of these topics OP mentioned probably apply to Hardenbergh and Frelinghuysen too. I don't live there but I don't see why they wouldn't."

cquh0c2&AskScienceDiscussion&Atrayul&"No. Solar Systems rely on gravitational pull, and objects on a small scale don't have that kind of force. The force of gravity is a result of hugely warped space, which is a result of large bodies of mass, which is a result of lots of ""tiny objects"".

Even if Scientists found a way to make small objects ""orbit"" each other, it would only seem like a mini solar system, and would rely on an entirely different force to make the ""orbit"" work.

I couldn't take it anymore, and I'm like you know, I don't feel like you're into this. What's up? She was like ohh I'm just not in the mood this moment. I was really shocked, and asked why would act like you wanted to? She said, and I shit you not, isn't this what wives are supposed to do?

Then it fucking hit me, she was raised in the Bible Belt and spoon fed that shit. I seriously asked her, tell me none of your previous boyfriends never said anything when you ""did your duty""? Granted there was only 2, but she said never seemed to bother them. So not only was she indoctrinated to believe this is normal, so we're the boys around her growing up. It's hard to me to think of them as rapists when many of them, if the probably only knew, wouldn't be cool with it.

People seriously are ok with banging people not fucking into one bit. Surprise, surprise, when I told her that was unacceptable and just reciprocate when she was into it, she turned into a beautiful, wonderful sexual butterfly that isn't ashamed anymore and wants it daily. "

cquh0gl&personalfinance&StructuralGeek&"Most retail financing arrangements are very heavily biased in favor of the store - high interest rates, prepayment penalties, high origination fees, etc.  Be very careful about this - you might try asking for a personal loan from your credit union. 

My recommendation though?  Go to a pawn store, or scour the web, for a used ring.  You could find just a stone that you like, and then take that to a jeweler to have a custom ring made to house it.  Then, take the remaining $5k and go do something like [this](https://alumniandfriends.uchicago.edu/lifelong-learning/travel/2015/discovering-eastern-europe).  Most schools have similar programs, and they frequently just partner with larger tour companies that would offer the same stuff without the university association."

Usually, if a taxi is dropping off a passenger, they will pull up in the bike lane next to the curb in order to prevent bicycles from passing. The taxi isn't allowed to park there, however it is essentially an unwritten rule that they can pull up to drop someone off. The driver would have clearly known that there were bicycles coming up on the inside, and the passenger should have looked out of the back window to check for cyclists seeing as there is the gutter bike lane up the inside.

But as of about five or six months ago, I've been way too overwhelmed with the amount of stuff they're putting out. I've pretty much stopped watching the minecraft let's plays (they've grown stale on me for a while), and now really only watch GO!, VS, GTA, and some of the independent let's plays that they put out (with the exception of they're classics like Worms and Minigolf, I'll always love those). Don't get me wrong, I love RT and I have for many years, but there *is* a thing as too much of a good thing.

cquh0n8&DarkSouls2&Be_Cool_Bro&He becomes much simpler if you stack fire defense.  I've phantomed this guy so much and few people seem to know.  The worst part is his fire breath which can hit 3 times and two shot you with low fire defense.  If you have the hexer or chaos set, use flash sweat, the dispelling ring, and the red flame defense ring +2 you can cut the damage by about 70~80% depending on your int/faith (which boost fire defense when levelled).  If all else fails you can do this and summon help, just not any NPC since they suck for this fight.  Once you can tank his fire attacks he becomes much less of a threat.  His physical hits hit like a truck regardless of armor so dont worry about low physical defense.

-The center of orbit between the two object is located within the mass of our planet

-The moon has much lower radius than any object in the solar system currently classified as a planet.

-There are currently no classifications with binary planet systems.

I have not heard of any serious talk about classifying the Moon as a planet. It perfectly fits the designation of a satellite of our planet. The satellites Titan and Ganymede are both considerably larger, larger even than Mercury and almost Mars, but there is no serious movement to change their classification either.

cquh0qt&AskReddit&TheGomp_&For me, and as most people have said, I don't dislike human interaction.  It's just when I've reached my limit of exhaustion, and people still want to interact, I start to get frustrated, and want to have some alone time.  I have a pretty small, tight friend group that spends most of our time talking online, or in person, but there are days when I want to just hang out by myself, and watch YouTube videos, or movies.  That causes some tension, because they obviously want to talk to me because we are friends, but they end up stressing me out with how hard they press me sometimes.  It's not like I can't hold a conversation with other people, but after a decent dose of social interaction, I need some time to recover.

cquh0qz&AskReddit&chevron_seven_locked&"Because getting beaten up doesn't typically strip you of your bodily autonomy.

Because getting beaten up doesn't typically have the potential to force a pregnancy or STD.

Because getting beaten up is typically an external phenomenon. 

Have you ever talked to rape victims, or read their stories? Rape is *excruciatingly* personal. Often victims are smaller or physically weaker than their rapists, and unable to fight them off. Often victims are threatened with death, and forced to commit devastating acts in order to live, such as telling their rapist that he/she is ""the best they've ever had"", or performing oral sex. The events of rape physically and psychologically plague many victims for years.

Rape is a comprehensive, internal and external violation of bodily autonomy. Rape tells the victim that their autonomy (often tied to our sense of self and independence) doesn't matter.

Look at how much shame comes with rape. ""She shouldn't have gone walking around in that outfit at 2am."" ""She kissed him first, so she led him on."" ""He had an erection, clearly he wanted it."" These messages tell victims that they deserved it. Furthermore, rape victims whose bodies exhibit sexual response, such as erection or orgasm during rape, send even more confusing and shameful messages.

Assault is terrible, getting beaten up is terrible. Nobody here is challenging that. But to say that rape is no different frankly sounds very ignorant."

cquh0rr&relationships&Mystic-Spiral&"I think it's obvious to you by now that your wife I gay. It's a shitty situation and she really just needs to be honest with you and herself about the fact that she wants to be with a woman. If you are considering divorce you need to make sure you have proof of her infidelity. It seems shitty, but the courts are still highly in favor of mother's getting primary custody. You don't want to make her out to be a bad parent, but it does need to be clear that *she* is the reason for the divorce. If you can divorce amicably, with her admitting to the infidelity and to being gay, all the better. The process is much better when both parties are on the same page and working towards a singular goal and not trying to take each other down. And ultimately the goal should be what is beat for child; which would be involvement from both parents working jointly to raise a child that they brought in to the world together regardless of current situations. 

Sorry you are in a tough situation, there's no easy way to deal with it and no cure all advice. If you feel done, be done, if you feel.you can keep trying to fix it, the keep seeking counseling. Do what you feel.is best for you, your wife, your child, and your family as a whole."

cquh0s9&cyclocross&dude_the_dirt_farmer&"Depends a lot on what the roads are like. If they are freshly graded like a day before, 32mm with some knobbies helps an awful lot...but...most dirt roads are pretty smooth really and a road bike that can fit 28mm road tires is going to be a TON faster than something with 32mm+ with knobs and comfortable enough.  If theres lots of smooth stuff with some looser gravel mixed in, 35mm panaracer paselas are excellent because they have a very ""V"" shape cross section that doesn't put too much rubber on the road when its hard but also digs in a bit when it gets loose to give stability without having to ride with knobbies that rob tons of speed on 85% of the rest of the road.

I have a Fuji Cross too and it's the most comfortable frame I have really...with the size of tires you run on dirt, the frame material is not going to make much difference.   I'm on a carbon CX bike now (90% of my riding is on dirt) and there is really no difference in comfort, it's a teeny bit lighter, no difference in stiffness. 
What kind of pressure do you run? You bike should be super comfy on 41mm tires unless they are pumped up like crazy.

 I don't think the handling issue is from something wrong with the Fuji, you probably want to try a longer stem to take out some twitch if its there.   

I run a carbon disc frame with either some alu rims/panaracer 32mm gravel kings for rough stuff, or carbon 38mm rims with 28mm road tires when the roads are pretty smooth. I have mechanical shimano CX77s which are ok...the Hayes CX experts I have on the Fuji Cross are much better mech calipers. I'm running a 50/34 and Force22, I stuck a 11-36t cassette on with a X7 derailleur which is pretty handy on the hills here...I'm still pushing well over 300w at 70rpm grannied out on an awful lot of the tops of some of the hills you get on dirt roads.  Sissy brake levers can be handy too as it can be a little less taxing on your arms riding the tops. "

Stardusk does make a point in one of his rebuttals that he doesn't bother to dumb his shit down, he feels most men ought to be able to grasp wtf he's talking about, and there doesn't need to be ""beginner"" and ""advanced"" level MGTOW categories.

cquh0uj&dayz&alaskafish&"I posted a few [statements](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/2w75a5/reworking_rdayzs_rules/), publicly, on the state of moderation. It was coming from my opinion. I knew many people wanted to understand what was going on internally of the mod team. They wanted some transparency for our ideas and contents. 

I said that I disagreed with the team, hardheartedly on this, because it would be like turning this sub into a forum. You don't have mega threads on a sub. That's what forums are for. So I do. I give my opinion. Now, I understand why I was removed. I was giving information from the team, that was not discussed with the team. I guess I was like the Edward Snowden of /r/DayZ. I don't want to hit two stones together, but, many of the things they put into action was done without my consent or opinion. Not saying that since they did that, I could do this. But, I hope you see where I'm going. 

In the post, I said that I've been trying my hardest to steer this sub into being a subreddit rather than a forum. From the start of Suggestion Sunday, before it was released, I said it was a bad idea. Many of the things the moderation team wants to do is make this a forum. Different boards for different topics. But obviously, that cannot be done on Reddit. There are not boards. So their solution was to come up with weekly posts dedicated to an event. ""Suggestion Sunday"", ""Silly Saturday"", ""Noobie Tuesday"", among the many summer camp related titles. 

When I publicly said that the reason this subreddit was considered to what many people consider ""toxic and horrible"", was because of the direction the moderation team wants to go with it. Publicly, I stating that and quote; ""Being negative"" and ""Being a mad mod"" is what got me off the team. Funnily enough, it was around that point I considered leaving. I saw that what I suggested to them wasn't going to happen. I just didn't want to leave because I spent so many years on this sub that, getting Mod was amazing. But when I got it, I was pretty disappointed from all the red-tape. 

So was I removed for disagreeing? Yes and no. Like I said above, the short term effect of me getting the boot was from the statement I made. But the the longer term effect was me always being negative. They'd always believe that I was just being negative... even when I was giving their ideas a list of pros, and a list of cons. But when the cons outweighed the pros... boom; negative. I truly believed that you cannot limit suggestions. I think you cannot have **any** specific gaming subreddit without suggestions. Sure, suggestions are still here. But they were all dumped into a shitty mega-thread that no one cares to read since all the suggestions are (and I'm sorry), pretty shitty. 

Reddit is an amazing tool to gauge quality. The upvote/downvote system, as easy as it may be, tells what people want to see. And I repeat... it's what **the people want** to see. If the people want to upvote a shitty cat gif, and the majority want that, then, good on them. Believe it or not, many of the things that people hate, like reposts, bad suggestions, and low effort posts, used to be blocked from the front page, just by users like you. Sometimes they'd appear, but they wouldn't get so far. I see Reddit as an amazing place where the people run it. And I really didn't like the idea of the moderation staff deciding to literally censor opinions, deleting posts, and blatantly removing the right to post certain things. That's what, you, the users are in charge. I think the ideal moderation team is there to simply moderate. Did someone post something not related to DayZ, then away with that post. Send them a message saying, ""I'm sorry, but what you did was not really in the scope of the sub"". Just be the bigger person over-watching the people run it themselves. That was my goal on this sub. I wanted to try my hardest to do such. 

However, I don't want to seem one sided. The moderation team is trying their absolute **hardest** to improve this subreddit. What people don't understand (and I was shocked as soon as I received the title of moderator), how much **shit** these guys go through. The Mod Mail is full of people calling them, really, terrible insults and so on. The one guy saying that ""DayZ will always be in alpha"" or ""it was a cash grab for Dean"", is just the tip of the iceberg that goes unnoticed. There are posts, seriously linking to rape videos on sketchy websites with titles like ""We should add this"". They're doing a ~~decent~~, a great job moderating. Keeping the stuff people really don't want to see, out. The truth is, they're taking a step further... in the wrong way. Restricting things to post, many, *many*, unclear rules/too many rules. 

All I can say, is just understand the moderation team. They're trying... trying so hard. It's unbelievable the lengths they take to keep this sub a whole heap less toxic than it is. They're great moderators. But The way they're trying to bring toxicity down on the sub, in my opinion, is the wrong way. They're suppose to just overlook the sub, and deal with things that are out of the people's control. The truth is, the people who are here daily should be the ones running this place. Have the moderation staff, just delete the posts that the majority want deleted. Delete the posts that are just, not ethically and morally correct. 

I'll end this essay simply by stating that you cannot run anything, be it a government, a company, or a subreddit, with the intentions of having absolute/close to absolute power. It just doesn't work. The community will rebuild it's self as long as you allow the community to be who it is. I know a lot of shit got to the front page of this sub; it's a reason I wanted to join. But deleting it and walking away, is just not the right thing to do as a moderator. 

If a moderator ends up reading this. I hope you don't take any of this the wrong way. Take it as my thought on the outcome of the subreddit as a long time user, ex-part of the staff, and now just a person who finds her way onto the sub whenever a friend posts something here. Hate me all you want, I still have the same intentions as you the moderation staff, and everyone on the sub. A friendly sub, where people were welcome, and you could chat with the developer within an instant. Like it was before the Standalone was released. It sounds too good to be true, but I still truely believe, it can *slowly* make it's way there. 

All I want is this sub to be good. "

Just remember that *any* effort towards the disc stops the delay and would prevent a stall from ever initiating.

* If you are a 36 year old watching an earthbound highschool romance and you expect something more complex than a love triangle, *you're gonna have a bad time.*

* The main character is not *intended* to be likeable, but there's a whale of a difference between liking characters and a series or its ending. What is the point in having literature if you have to follow a formula and aren't prepared to accept an ending which doesn't make everybody happy?

And also the things that he *didn't* mention: 

* [](/s ""It's a lot better than a usual love triangle ending where the losing girl happily gives up the guy because she's such a good friend."")

And in defense of Kitahara: 

* [](/s ""As someone who has been cheated on, I can objectively say that it isn't the worst thing that can happen to you. Everybody gets cheated on. You get over it."") 

* [](/s ""In any case, he is anything but rewarded for it. Kasuza ups and leaves rather than stay with him because that's the sensible thing to do. In fact, the fact that she's leaving only makes it more understandable as to *why* he cheats on Setsuna."")

If I could go back, what I would have done was:

* 500mg Test Enanthate
* 500mg Tren Enanthate
* 20-30mg Superdrol 

I would just have permablasted that on a bulk until I was massive, then cut on DNP and Test until I was really lean.


Then I would have run:

* 250mg Test Enanthate
* 600-800mg Mast Enanthate
* 25mg Dbol
* 50mg Var


The theory here is that the Test is low enough to prevent use of an AI, the Mast will keep you looking and feeling good with a high libido, the Dbol is enough to allow you to make gains without giving you tits, and Dbol makes you feel great too. The anavar is there for collagen synthesis and joint protection.


That's my ideal stack for looking and feeling incredible with a huge libido, minimal sides, and still making solid gains.

cquh0ym&IWantOut&theresnorevolution&"I'm surprised you rated Ireland so high. They may have a high disposable income, but from what I understand, the economy is still in really bad shape. Ireland would be great IF you have a job. But most of the Irish expats I meet (and there are tons in Aus) say they wish they could go home, but don't feel there's a future there. These are college educated, hard-working people- so it's pretty telling they've flown across the globe to find work.

And to exclude Australia because it's isolated? Yea, it's isolated from Europe and the US; but Aussies travel a HELL of a lot. If you live in the north, you can be in SE Asia easily. Likewise, if you're on the east coast you can visit a number of PI destinations. If anything, I'd look at availability of travel (I.e. Number of airports, modes of transportation, frequency of services, etc.) as a metric for isolation.

Bran is chief wizard, most often seen warging all three of his dragons (formerly Dany's) at the same time. Qyburn invents robotic legs so that Bran can walk again. Arya is chief assassin. Tyrion is once again Hand of the King. The free folk take over the Iron Islands and Casterly Rock and live there until the end of time. The Mountainstein Monster and Hodor are best friends and they roam the countryside wrestling bears. Brienne of Tarth becomes Brienne of Qarth, as she single-handedly takes over all of Qarth and restores it back to its original splendour. Tri-Podrick becomes Chief Prostitute in Qarth. The Mannis ascends to heaven as Rh'llor incarnate and blesses the land with infinite summer. Davos Seaworth's fingers miraculously come back. He becomes Lord of Dragonstone and restores it to greatness in Valyrian fashion. Sam becomes Grandmaester.

Cersei trips over a glass of wine, shatters it, and a shard goes straight through her neck, killing her. The end.

**EDIT** Qarth, not Quarth. 

**EDIT 2** Hot Pie and Shireen Baratheon become entrepreneurs (they invent the printing press, but with gravy instead of ink) and end up becoming the richest husband and wife in Westeros.

cquh125&AskReddit&FieldMarshalOfNorway&"When I was twelve years old, the teacher was sick one day. So we had a temporary teacher for the day. I think it was the second last hour, we had a test and afterwards when we finished, we were allowed to go to the computer room and do whatever. (Which was very holy in elementary school).

Anyways, when the ten first of us were done, the rest was not allowed to go the the computers. So natrually, when all the rest was finished, we started complaining. He asked us to be silent, but we were stubborn 12 year olds, so we continued to complain about him beeing unfair. 

Suddenly out of the blue, he just snapped, slammed his fist in his desk and shouted: ""Shut the fuck up! I'm getting fucking annoyed here! You're all acting childish as fuck! Now shut the hell up before I really punish you little fuckers!""
My class went dead silent after that, until a poor girl started to cry.

cquh12a&buildapc&Amy-Acker&"The NEX is a mediocre unit. An EVGA (G2, GS, B2), XFX, Seasonic or Antec (HCG, TPC, Edge) would be better. 

The X61 isn't worth the money, IMO. At this price, a Swiftech H220X or H240X would be better and cost only slightly more. Either that or a Noctua DH14/15 or Phanteks TC12/14. 

Motherboard is overkill but it's top-of-the-line. The case isn't really worth $90; a Phanteks Enthoo Pro, H440 or 450D would be better IMO.

The risk reward structure has shifted dramatically.  It may not be the kind of behavior you prefer, but that doesn't mean that people aren't making a rational risk/reward calculation.

Also you're assuming that the motivation of polygamists could, of course, be only sex.  That's a pretty common assumption, but not necessarily true either - if sex was the only issue there are plenty of other strategies that don't involve a marriage commitment."

cquh15h&DestructiveReaders&shinkhi&"I made suggestions on your doc as shelby.foister. 

I'm not familiar with the Borges so I can't comment on the relevance of the piece.

First thing I noticed was the way the dialog is structured. I'm not really a big fan of the ""-"" signifying different people, but I assume maybe this is a way around a word restriction or something? I got the point anyway so I guess it doesn't matter too much.

Second, the descriptions of the clothing seems like an afterthought and didn't help my visual image of the characters. If the description came earlier it would have helped me see these guys.

Third, I enjoyed that the ""heretic"" and the ""Inquisitor"" were probably friends at some point. Members of the same sect, religion or clan and now the Inquisitor is carrying out the law. That last embrace I imagine could be powerful if I was more familiar with the back story and/or characters. 

I understand it's just a quick piece but if there is anyway you could drag out the ending slightly, show a little more emotion it would be much more impactful. "
cquh15i&WTF&Tenshik&Or because it actually doesn't require much more than knowledge of high school curriculum. Which, shocker, most people have gone through. By far one of the easier jobs to get in terms of knowledge threshold. And yes I realize you can be a great teacher and know a whole lot about teaching, way more than would be necessary to teach high school. But that's not what's required to teach HS. Throw some work problems at them and tell them to read the book.

cquh168&AskReddit&bracketdash&Well, I went to a commuter campus, and lived about 20 minutes away. This one morning, I think it was a Tuesday, I got into my car and drove to campus. When I arrived, I couldn't park in the spot I usually do because someone had already taken it. I thought that was really weird, but then I noticed a lot more cars were parked in that lot than I usually see this time of morning. So I check my phone to see what time it is. You know, to make sure I didn't accidentally sleep in. I was alright, so I found a parking spot a little further back, and get to class. Then I start asking around about why so many more people were on campus today, and nobody knew why. I was wondering about it all through class, and when it was finally over, I was walking in the hallway on my way to the cafeteria, then I saw it. There was a flyer on the bulletin board for a special event. Some kind of highschool college campus visit thing. Apparently they have these every once in a while, or maybe once a semester or something, where parents will take their high school kids to campuses of colleges that they think their kids might attend once they graduate. I'm glad I solved that mystery. Pretty crazy story.

cquh171&Christianity&luke-jr&"Gays can already get married just as much as anyone else can. The problem is when they want to pretend *a completely different relationship* is marriage. And to make it worse, that relationship (sodomy) is gravely sinful.

If gays asked for legal privileges *similar to those of marriage*, but without trying to taint the term ""marriage"", they'd get further. Even moreso if they advocated for those privileges equally for other non-sodomite relationships (eg, brother+sister, monks, nuns, non-sodomite same-sex flatmates, etc)."

Despite the recent tear everyone's been on against his defense (coincidentally since Zach Lowe tweeted that he thought Dame was awful on D, shocking that eh?) he was actually much improved on that end for the first 40-50 games.

Then he hit his shooting slump, his confidence and his defense then slumped with it. This is actually the third cycle like this he's had, where he's unreal for a couple of months, looks easily a top 5 PG, then it drops a bit because his 3 ball stops falling. He had a slump his rookie year, a slump last year, and a slump this year, and every time the media (and the /r/nba echo chamber) jumps on his back like he's lost that ability. It's crazy.

For example, the vehicle with the current land speed record isn't something I'd like to drive to and from work every day. I need something that can do 60-80 mph comfortably and for a long time. That's what swiftkey offers. Swiping with swiftkey may not be ""record breaking"" but it's a lot more comfortable. Customizable long press, multiple in line language support, it has all the features I want.

If you're afraid that a blog you're posting may be satirical or a troll, [here are some tips to help you discern the fake crazy from the real shit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/wiki/trolls).

* **General Tumblr humor goes to /r/loltumblr.**  This means funny shit you found that has to do with Tumblr. Plain and simple.

* **Sanity posts go to /r/TumblrAtRest.** A sanity post highlights someone reacting reasonably to SJW bullshit and/or calling out said bullshit. Basically, offering logic where there was none. Pointing out sanity is not the focus of this sub, but submissions that contain someone lecturing a SJW are a-ok, as long as the post is meant to put a spotlight on SJW idiocracy. So, as a general rule of thumb: *The post should primarily focus on some SJW acting ridiculous, not any logical smackdowns they're receiving.* **NOTE: The only exception to this rule is on Sundays, for ""Sanity Sunday"" where these types of posts are allowed on TiA, in order for this to work properly start the title of your submission with [Sanity Sunday].**

* **Discussion and Meta posts go to /r/TiADiscussion.** This includes AMAs, talks about personal experience with SJWs, complaints about the main TiA sub, etc. 

* **YouTube videos and comments are banned from /r/TumblrInAction** - [seriously, this fruit is so low-hanging that it's subterranean, and it's a bitch to verify](http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/2iam5k/a_slightly_larger_rule_amendment/).

* **Post not suited for TiA**
Things like ""I Need feminism because"" posts are one example of something that has a better home than TiA.  There are many others, but I am not going to list them all here.  You will get a removal reason with a suggestion for a better suited sub to post your submission on. 

* **Banned topics/Common Reposts**  Every now and then a topic or specific post is added to either our banned topic list or common repost list.  Banned topics are usually announced with a reason.  Common Reposts on the other hand are dynamic and ever expanding.  [Many will be in our wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/wiki/reposts) but many more are in AutoMod's programming. If you post one of these posts you will get a removal reason stating that it is on one of these lists.

PM the mods if you have any questions.

cquh1aw&AskScienceFiction&BitOBear&"It will remain in its _chosen_ _orbit_. Period. Not stationary with respect to a mass.

Whenever it's not taken up it exercises significant discretion. It would probably avoid falling into a sun. When it was holding Loki to The Bifrost it still let him breathe but it didn't let him slink out from under it. When it was on the deck-plate of the helicarrier, even while denying the Hulk, it didn't exert any appreciable forces on the carrier itself. If it didn't have these traits Thor would have to clutch it to his chest whenever he showered or took to the restroom while at sea or on the carrier etc.

I could conceivably pick it up and move it with its consent even while being denied the ability to ""wield"" it. Such largess would be rare indeed, but not against the spirit nor the letter of the rules.

For instance if it was left somewhere that would prevent an ambulance full of bleeding orphans from reaching help, and I were the ambulance driver, and my sole motive was to move the hammer so that I can get the orphans to safety, that motive might make me ""worthy enough"" to drag it a few feet, but not so much worthy enough to call lightning and smite foes.

cquh1c6&Cynicalbrit&hunterofspace&"Reading the comments its like I'm listening to a different video.

Yeah this was one sided, but it was meant to be. If there was a consumer sitting in this chat trying to rebut every point they made then the video would be completely shit. I'm immediately thinking of that Hannity and Colmes show.

That said, i agree with most of [Smokus](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/34f1qd/an_indepth_conversation_about_the_modding_scene/cqu4an7)'s post and the discussion isn't hitting a lot of the points, particularly concerns over stability and just the suitability of the system as a whole. 

They kept saying that they didn't let the community decide, or let the money decide. But they neglected that this entire implementation was garbage. I mean they mentioned that, but there wasn't an appreciation of just how awful the system is, with the points in [Smokus](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/34f1qd/an_indepth_conversation_about_the_modding_scene/cqu4an7)'s post being key. 

Regardless was pretty good discussion. My hope as always, (as it was during the gamergate shit when that started) was i'd like to see the discussion continue because as these guys said themselves, what should have happened was people should have been consulted in order to create the best system possible. 

This video made a lot of good points which would be good to see more calm minds weigh in on in order to continue the discourse. If this is the last big video we get on this then yay for failure. But if we get someone to just come in and focus on some of Brumbek's more inflammatory (but honestly rather accurate) comments then it's gonna be a shit discussion. 

There's plenty more to discuss here, and if they're gonna remake the system then that discussion MUST continue."

Even with an MS you're unlikely to be engaging in commercial research for that kind of system. (I'm currently in a PhD program in a related field in bioengineering.)

That being said, the best way to figure this out is to try to find job listings for the positions you're interested in and see what they're asking for in terms of qualifications.

Also, keep in mind that most PhD programs have an option to drop out at MS or MEng if you realize the full ~5 years isn't for you."

After having had one internship for one summer, I realized that the challenging design projects rarely came, and that much of graphic design was the monotonous 'bitch' work. The fact that most companies also chose the safest designs of your concepts were also not much help. 
I recently got into an in-house situation, and while there are some problems that required more design thinking, it still consists of a large amount of setting type over predictable images that are not as stimulating "

We didn't use protection but we didn't even really have sex he just stuck it in a bit (with consent) but I decided to stop.

The other big thing is keeping your weight off your toes and more on your sole and heel. For rough terrain you can even 'pick up' your toes a bit as you get into it to make sure you don't catch that front wheel.

I don't think RDJ completely ruled out ever doing an indie film, it's just going to take considerably more personal interest in the project to get him to do it because there are in general far more negatives to him than positives.

cquh1q5&ClashOfClans&Zamma111&"I was talking from the perspective of players on the same level. Obviously, I have no chance as a th9 of getting 3 stars on a max th10. But in a war scenario, I wouldn't ever attack a th10 so I didn't even entertain that idea. Should have made it clear I am talking about equals practicing on each other.

Yeah, as I was typing it out I saw the positive sides of what I was saying but I was also aware of the positives being in an ideal scenario. More custom base designs are great but then again most people are bad at base design and would just opt for some simple base because they might have the mentality of no point in bothering if someone can just pick apart my design weaknesses. I thought about the less copy+paste too, also a good thing, but also would there be less? If someone has a great design that's been able to hold up against several real attacks continuously, why not just all switch to that base because clearly even with practice and repetitive tries it's still held strong. Obviously it's a bad idea to have the same base repeating itself in your clan for the reason that it just takes one person to find the strategy, but with sandboxing, if people still haven't figured out how to beat it, it's a pretty safe bet to just copy it. I didn't think positively of the shifting meta only because it would tend to shift towards cookie cutter builds that have held up against countless pratice attacks which leads up to my thought process that people will just copy bases from other clanmates.

I definitely am with you on offense over defense. I don't care at all about my defenses really. Like you said, it's passive gaming and that does nothing for me. I think rather the difference is that all I see are balance issues whereas all you see is more gameplay and I don't want to face potential imbalance for more gameplay."

cquh1rd&NoStupidQuestions&OlympiaBinewski&Hijab is an Arabic word so it's probably safe to assume that a woman wearing hijab is Muslim - or perhaps just following Muslim law because she's in a Muslim country or community - but there are other religions that require women to cover their hair when in public, usually with a scarf, snood or wig (e.g. Orthodox Jewish), bonnet (e.g. Amish), or veil (e.g. strict Catholic). In general, I wouldn't assume any religious customs are such 'common knowledge' that you would be rude for asking about them IF you already know the person and the topic comes up.

cquh1sx&buildapc&bomerr&"The thing is 1080p is decidedly last gen. 1440p monitors have been readily available for a good price for like 2 years now. Plus 4k is right around the corner of mainstream. (4k, 32"" IPS panels hit sub 1000 last black friday. So next black friday should be awesome.) In other words you are overspending hard.

 If you really want 1080 then get a 970 and a monitor for no more than $150; you'll save 300-400 dollars on the build. 

If you're serious about editing then you're better off just getting a 5820k like I did. If you plan to keep the cpu a long time (3-4yr) it's probably worth investing in a 6 core anyways. 

Also most modern games are ike 60gb (gta v, assassins creed, bf4) and trust me when I say the load times off hdd (at least for the last 2) sux. I have a 256gb ssd and it's okay but if i was building a PC today I'd prob get a 500gb samsung 850 evo. (you could also channel that gpu/monitor savings into the ssd and good keyboard)

cquh1tn&Wicca&greybeard45&"Merry Meet.  Sometimes Google works.  Our coven is the first listing if you google for ""Wicca (our city)""   Sometimes it doesn't work.   I usually suggest looking at ATCwicca.org and witchvox.com for listings nearby.  You can also try Paganspace.net,  thepaganveil.com, meetup.com, and other on-line networking groups.  

If none of those work for your particular area, you probably contact someone from a pagan store, pagan gathering, or a Wiccan group a little farther away.  They likely will know other regional groups.  Word of mouth is a good way to find a good group.  First find events or other groups nearby that may be able to help. 

Another suggestion I often make is to relocate yourself to where a coven is located.  While there are Wiccan covens in many places we are not everywhere.  A Christian who wants to be a Priest or minister, for example, expects to relocate to a city where a Christian seminary is located and to live there while he studies and becomes Ordained.  Likewise it is not unreasonable for a witch joining the Wiccan priesthood to relocate to join a coven of the Tradition you want to become part of.  After a period of study, usually 3 years and 3 days or more, you may be an Ordained member of their Tradition and can begin a branch coven back home in your home town.  

What location are you looking for covens?  "

ALSO if you're really interested in a career in policing then I recommend applying to forces in other cities as well. The days of WPS force expansion are over and they're under a microscope with their budget. First thing to get cut is recruiting. Five years ago they were hiring 100 officers a year. I don't think they've hired more than 40 in the last couple of years combined. All I'm saying is competition is insane to get on with WPS right now. "

cquh1xg&asoiaf&TriSkeith13&"It's not as vulnerable as people would like to think. It's just not impossible, especially when it's garrison doesn't keep a strong vigilance to its Northern flank. The Greyjoy's were able to do so because the Northern force keeping it expected any attack to come from the South. The Ironmen were not as foolish. Victarion Greyjoy, Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet and held Moat Cailin for the majority of the war with the strongest force of Iron Men. The ""hard heart"" as it's been called. Any attempt would have been a madhouse of slaughter on both sides. This is added to the understanding that the Ironborn held Winterfell. As many who call Theon's taking of Winterfell his follay, and it was, it was to Victarion's benefit. 

The Crannogmen could have antagonized the Greyjoy force at Moat Cailin and caused untold damage, but as long as Theon held Winterfell and the Reed's hostage, Howland Reed wouldn't risk his heirs. Theon essentially kept the North at bay by holding the Royal Heirs hostage as well. 

The love of the Starks is not only the Northmen's strength, it's partially their weakness. Greenlanders still remember the fall of House Justman after all. "

cquh1xx&leagueoflegends&kelustu&"A lot of people, myself included, are annoyed that there are no in-game rewards for time played or achievements. One skin once a year, for a champion that has generally been nerfed soon after? A ward skin if you spam games with a team? Oh boy. 

It's highly underwhelming. This seemed like a good way to introduce a reward system with in-game content for people who do well, and instead it was turned towards profit. I used to buy a ton of skins, I won't be buying anymore unless there's some form of actual in-game reward anymore. More and more of Riot's model is to move things away from IP and into RP, doing so can alienate people who previously spent RP.

Simply increasing the ways in which people can pay you does not actively increase the profit. "

If more Asian males want to be CEOs then maybe more Asian males should try starting their own companies instead of playing the oppression Olympics in a white mans game.  The same way I believe if women think more girls should program then maybe they should pick up a book and learn to code instead of whine-blogging about it constantly.

The black community can sit around crying about white oppression but they are never going to get anywhere until they find leaders and role models within their own community to break them out of the vicious cycle they are in. The solution is not going to come by way of handouts.

Every group and every individual is born with a different set of obstacles, hardships and discrimination in one form or another.  If you a born into a less fortunate set of circumstances or genetics then you're just going to have to work twice as hard as the next guy.

If the guy had really been a threat and you could justify drawing like say the ""attacker"" had brandished any kind of weapon then by all means go for it but people die, sometimes they dont deserve it but it happens your gun wont save you from everything and you should not solely rely on it especially in situations like that is all im saying but  people like you are the reason guns have a bad image.

The NDP does in fact have a plan to pay to balance the budget.  It's only been one of the biggest points in the campaign:  raising the corporate tax rate to 12%, instituting a progressive income tax scale, etc... and it's been gone over in this election numerous times including having been a focus in the debates.  So for someone to come on here saying ""they don't have a plan"" when they've detailed it and their opponents have discussed these details is just downright idiocy."

cquh23j&Smite&Shazamwiches&"He doesn't mean the AOE.  The AOE isn't really helpful for his 1v1.  The issue he brings up is with the attack chain you propose, his attacks take longer to land. 

For example, look at Loki's attack chain. He has 3 very fast attacks and 1 strong slow one at the end.  This makes sense considering the 3 fast ones do less damage and the slow one does much more.  Looking at other attack chains, you can see the the amount of damage a certain part of the chain does is directly related to how long it takes for another part of the same chain to execute.

Osiris depends on his attack speed for damage, that's why you build attack speed items on him.  By making his attack speed chain 1/.75/1/.75, it slows down his attack speed and makes them hit harder.  With how little power most people in solo or jungle will build him, this change will be more of a nerf than a buff because it is now taking 16% longer with slightly more damage, with in the long run will actually decrease his DPS, making him less of a warrior, and more of an annoying nuisance that delivers slows, meatshields and takes away your healing, like Odin with more reliable damage."

The highschool would let you out for two days in the spring if you got so many points over your 'goal' for scoring on the test. Kids figured out that they would graduate anyway, so they would just bomb the tests so next the next year they would have a lower score and be able to pass it easily.

I have had to take a decent sized cocktail of drugs because of a car wreck, fortunately I'm on less drugs than immediately after the accident. Although I'm on something pretty powerful for seizures that I'll never be off of. I know that previously I'd let my guard down when taking it, because I wasn't having seizures I'd think it was okay to skip a dose. When it comes to certain things, taking the stuff that is keeping you from having the major medical issue and not stopping is really important.

cquh27b&PrettyLittleLiars&Rikvidr&Only the riots currently in question aren't a bunch of people with protest signs, nor were they in Ferguson. There was an overwhelming number of people breaking into storefronts of McDonalds, Payless Shoes, Walmart, and stealing everything they saw fit to. If you can explain to me how that helps stop police brutality, go ahead. Go look at the happenings at [Euromaidan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan). Yes, they were violent, *but* they were focused **solely** at the police, and the government. They rallied on the steps of political buildings, in the central square of Kiev, not in front of their nearest department store to steal Xbox Ones. If you wade through the videos on Liveleak, you will notice them flipping the cars *at* the political buildings, and leaving the other cars alone. They brought the pain, and they brought it to the right people. They threw molotov cocktails at the police, not each other. When the Ukranian government turned the electricity in that area off, in hopes that the frigid cold would prompt the rioters to disperse, back to their warm homes, instead of sitting in sub-zero conditions, the rioters broke into the political buildings and used tables, chairs, anything they could, to bring outside and set ablaze to keep warm. They didn't break into 7-11's and steal from them.

You can rent a place or a room for ~$100-$300 aud depending on what you want pretty close to the city (but coming from the states everything will be close to the city in comparison). Nurses are paid pretty well but its definitely worth getting onto Medicare. Have a look at the nurses awards on the gov websites. Feel free to pm me if you want more info :)

Sex without a condom is the best. It's warm and wet and feels natural. 

And this is one of the reasons why I only have sex in exclusive, stable relationships. Outside of that, I do not have sex. No condoms for me. I'd rather go without sex for a while than have sex with a condom.

cquh28q&pcmasterrace&Idle_Redditing&"No, it's outrageous.

Bethesda got their acceptable amount of money from the vanilla game + dlcs that they worked on.  They do nothing to work on the mod and do nothing to maintain compatibility over time.  Valve (I'm not sure about Bethesda too) basically said ""sucks for you"" if an update came along and the mods were incompatible.

I also forgot to mention the part about how both did nothing about the theives who ripped mods off of Nexus and sold them on Steam.

I also doubt that the distribution platform is really so hard to make to justify a minimum of 30% of all sales going to Valve.

edit.  The mods are also basically the #1 reason to buy Skyrim since Bethesda releases incomplete games and counts on modders to finish it for them."

cquh299&PurplePillDebate&kkjdroid&"RPers have what I view as an unhealthy view of relationships--they see them as competitions rather than cooperatives in far too many cases. I understand where the cynicism comes from, but they take it well beyond where it should go.

BPers are still in the 1950s with their feminism, so they're fighting an imaginary enemy. Women are paid the same for the same work, and it's illegal for that not to be the case. Society does not support rape. The only rape culture is in prisons. Women are treated better in most situations. Dating is far more difficult for men.

cquh29q&whowouldwin&NamedByAFish&"Taylor Hebert is ranked better than MCU Iron Man and MCU Thor? *You're god-damned right.* Also, doesn't she technically count as a Swarm Round?

Fan moment aside, let's take a look at what I can do.

**First Ladder Power:** ~~[Almighty Ascension](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Almighty_Ascension)~~ Yeah, yeah. No omnipotence. Fine. Reroll into... [Mind Control](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Mind_Control). Well, it's not omnipotence. Let's go!

* Most of the early rounds are boring, except one: I make the two baseball players beat each other to death. ^^^Tee-hee!

* If mind control works on animals, I win all ten rounds no problem. If not, I die at the **SWARM ROUND.** Pretty simple. Continuing on:

**Second Ladder Powers:** Mind Control and... [Pollution Breath](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Pollution_Breath). My breath *STANK!*

* Another breeze all the way up to MCU Thor. I don't even have to use my new power on anyone, but I do on the Zerglings for fun.

* MCU Thor stomps my face off and uses my skull fragments to eat his Fruity Loops, assuming his Asgardian physiology gives him an innate resistance to psychic attacks like mind control. If he doesn't have psychic resists, He's just as easy as everyone else. Damn, Mind Control is OP. And on and on and up and up:

* Skitter I know doesn't have psychic resists because psychics don't exist in the Wormverse, and while I don't know the Night Angel series, Durzo Blint's wiki page doesn't mention anything about resisting mind control. If he can, well... pollution breath.

**Third Ladder Powers:** Mind Control, Pollution Breath, and... [Afterlife Transport](http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Afterlife_Transport). Fuckin' seriously? I get telepathic hypnosis, *soul reaping,* and legendary bad breath? Thanks, RNGeesus. I got two thirds of a theme going.

* Omni-Samus: Mind control and/or Afterlife transport has this in the bag.

* Iron Man: Soul = Reaped

* Wonder Woman: say hello to dead.

* Captain Planet: Oooh, another telepath! #soulreaped

* Thor.

* Thor.

* Thor.

* Thor.

* ...

* ...

* ***WELL I GUESS I FOUND MY ARCHNEMESIS, HUH?*** Eh, it's okay. I know I would have been stomped by the last four, anyway.

*****

**Edit:** A clarification.

**2nd Edit:** So I just watched Avengers: Age of Ultron, and [spoilers](#spoil ""yeah, MCU Thor totally doesn't have psychic resists. He thinks he does, but that doesn't count now does it?"")"

As well, the 30w box should be insanely easy to switch out batteries.  Only reason to go with a 150w is if you prefer the form factor for some reason.

It's also not fair to say that everyone else has to prove their claim except you, because we already know. If A sunni had said that it wouldn't be an argument."

cquh2ce&nfl&jdpatric&WTF CHIP KELLY?!? I WAS EXPECTING FIREWORKS!!!
cquh2cf&csgobetting&enochnekowang&this is literally super toss up. The matches that are SEEN on HLTV and people bet on are the only reason why their slightly tilted towards mostlyH statistically speaking its PERFECTLY DEAD EVEN based off stats from ESEA and Cevo which few people look up. People are using chain logic that since SKDC lost to MostlyH's best map and SKDC beat WinOut in a pretty close bo3 then obliviously MostlyH is better then WinOut. Im not sway1ng anything. I just feel this match deserves the 50/50 that it really is. But theres nothing I can do if the matches people happen to see makes them have chain logic. You can look up the stats urself on cevo and esea if you don't believe me. Also im good friends with vulcanium and pretty sure hes no longer in MostlyH

You must set a realistic price or an item for which you would instantly trade for every item you buy, sell, or trade here. For items that won't be traded one-to-one, you must set a specific number (i.e. 60 keys, $45 steam wallet). You may still ask for offers.

For instance, we have an election coming up very soon here in the UK and it's at a point where I've seen more about the american presidential campaign that barely just started or the racial tension that's currently going on.

Try becoming emotional when your best friend forgets to text you back. Try never being able to fully consummate your friendship. Try having sex dreams about your closest buddy.

The truth is that if you are ever going to change,  you can't fall into the trap of ""It's not my fault and I can't"". Even in the depth of my depression and the worst of the fatigue and pain, I always knew I needed to change.  I just needed to get over my mental hurdles. Even those were hard, but I didn't ignore my problems, I got a therapist as soon as I could afford it.

Chronic conditions can weaken you, or make you stronger. It is your choice. You can choose to be iron when you enter the forge, or precious gold that melts away. You can be three victim of your body, or the master of your life.

Not that I am perfect. I feel like a bitter little snowflake who wishes others could know how I felt each day so they would make life easier on me. But, life is too wonderful to just give in and give up.

cquh2lb&Indiemakeupandmore&arrpix&I also have this problem, so it isn't just you (it's what's putting me off buying the pressed versions tbh.) Not really a great fix for patchiness or blending issues (which I also have with the new ones) BUT what I do is basically layer something else on top. I use Doge because it's sheer and also my transition shade, but obviously you could use something different - I'd suggest either a sheer transition colour or a colour similar to the Blackbird shadow. It evens out the colour and makes it look quite seamless, and if the layering shadow has any shimmer or sheen to it the light reflecting will blur the effect of the whole thing and make it look really gorgeous. Of course, this really works best when your whole eye is Blackbird because it can be annoying keeping the overshadow to one area.

Ball construction and composition is what matters. A 2 piece ionomer cover ball (the top flites you have) will all be the same to you, regardless of brand. The more expensive balls are 3 or 4 (or 5) piece urethane cover ball will be very different than the others, and you might be able to tell a difference between brand (better players most certainly do). Quick Google search will tell you everything you want to know."

Smash exists in its own bubble, and with every new game comes a new fissure in the community. I would just like for the community to move on to the latest game. When I go to other fighting game forums/subreddits, it isn't a competition between previous games, and it all seems unanimous that people are moving forward with the new game. 

That's all I am confessing to what I want in a smash brothers game. Of course it will never happen, because the support for Melee is incredible, and the developers chose not to embrace what melee has become and instead chose to take the game into a different direction."

Should your significant other pay you? Notion that every work should be paid for is ridiculous. If this is the essence of the discussion, as you claim, then the answer is very clear 'in their wast majority - no, modders should not be compensated for making mods'. Reason? Because the mods are not real products. They have no strings that people tend to attach to a product, they don't equate to the standard that your average product equates to. There are only handful of mods that provide necessary quality. Most mods have copyright issues, stability and compatibility issues, support issues and so on. I would also argue that if people want to develop games and make money for it, than they don't need to search for ways to monetize mods. They can just be that - game developers. And a lot of modders do. A lot of them just became developers and create their own commercial games. And the ones that don't are either not interested enough or not professional enough, and in both of those cases I see no reason why they suddenly entitled to be paid for modding.

cquh2ou&explainlikeimfive&shaunsanders&"There are a lot of circumstances which added up to making the ""baby boomer"" generation one of the most unique and impactful generations on modern times. A few of the big ones:

* First, its important to know where they came from. After World War 2, much of the world's infrastructure (both civilian and manufacturing) was destroyed... except in the US, where our infrastructure was already ramped up for war production. So you have a bunch of victorious soldiers who came home to a healthy country in a world that was in need of manufactured goods. Those soldiers, and their families, benefited from this boost in wealth/productivity and the baby boomers were born out of this abundance of patriotism/wealth/health. Some believe this is where a sense of entitlement got rooted, in that you have an entire generation born into very good times, so when things started to become less good, they looked to blame other people, generations, etc. rather than accepting the ebb and flow of economy prosperity.

* Related to above, this generation is one of the largest supporters of personal independence and not relying on government welfare, as they relate it to their time of ""working hard to earn a living."" Unfortunately, they rarely take into account inflation, which means many of them were paid substantially more than minimum wage workers today. This inability to relate to workers causes a greater rift and helps justify the issues modern workers face (meaning, they don't see the issue as lack of regulation but, rather, lack of motivation from workers).

* Piggy backing on that point, while their generation has contributed to removing benefits they enjoyed from newer generations (cheap access to education, affordable housing, livable wages, etc.), they keep adding on to their own benefits under the belief that they have earned it. Increased healthcare costs (on top of them being one of the first generations to enjoy substantial boosts in average life span), substantial pension plans, retirement benefits, social security, etc. etc. etc. Baby boomers essentially paid for an increase in their standard of living by taking out a loan that our generations now must pay.

* Baby boomers were part of a time in history where we had the technology to really effectively screw with the environment on a global scale, but lacked the foresight/understanding to use restraint. As a result, natural resources have been plundered, many various chemicals have been released, entire patches of earth have been left useless as a result, which means that modern generations must figure out how to continue to grow while also limiting ourselves to offset the prior impacts on the environment.

In short, a lot of it comes down to the end of WWII creating a temporary economic utopia, and those who were born in that Eden influenced policy decisions that were unsustainable from the start, but perhaps seemed reasonable due to the fact that things had always been pretty good."

In a lot of ways Nick took this situation too much like how TB described some people took it, he was way too black and white about who exactly was protesting this move from Valve, too quick to just dismiss them as an angry uncontrollable mob, in the same way really as...well I don't wanna bring them up but, anti-GG does."

People also assume he doesn't track back or get stuck in because he's built in the small Spanish playmaker mould, but he's been one of our best players this season playing CM and when he's playing well he always gets a foot in.

EDIT: Interesting how this got downvoted lol, the dive I was referring to was West Brom. If you actually watched Cazorla for Arsenal (I admit I can't speak for Spain or his career in La Liga) you'd know that he hardly ever dives, especially considering how much he gets kicked.

I used vitamin E on my stomach when I was pregnant, I am not sure if that is what made the difference or not, but seriously, use that everywhere.  I never thought about the insides of my thighs!  I am sure there are other spots for other people, so use it daily all over and it should help.

My sister didn't use anything when she was pregnant and her stomach looks more like my mom's, though not as bad.

Edit-Also as to loose skin and saggy breasts-I don't have loose skin at all either, I think that was because I have always stayed in shape and I was able to bounce right back in addition to moisturizing with the Vitamin E.  Saggy breasts- well I am very small breasted so I don't have much issue with that, but whether you have a baby or not, your breasts are going to sag as you get older, nothing you can do about that but buy a good bra!

cquh2rg&Helldivers&talonoffire&"I find myself not using it anymore unless I'm also rocking the rep gun. Too many players don't understand it and get themselves killed. I must admit, I haven't been using them terribly clever either, most I used them for was missile defense.

I was using them for missile defense because you can put the tower right on the missile and the arcs don't hit the missile at all, but basically kicks you out of defending an entire other side of the missile lest you incur the wrath of Nikola. Again, though, I wasn't using them terribly clever. Probably really good to use them with static fields.

I find they are my replacement for Distracter beacons. If you are on the run, you can just plop one of them down, and they'll keep the enemy occupied just enough to lighten the stress on your team.

Edit: And here I am being an idiot without watching your video first, you did make use of static fields with them.

And in fact, you use my exact set-up (except I use the sickle)

1 - Bill Clinton  
2 - George W. Bush (2000-2001?)  
3 - John Kerry (2004-2005?)  
4 - Barrack Obama (2008-2009?)  
5 - Mitt Romney (2012-2013?)

cquh2s5&AdviceAnimals&flacciddick&Nope. Basic math says a salary of 150k means bunk with 500k of loans. After all taxes you're probably looking at 100k take home. But also there's 35k+ in just servicing the interest on the debt. So now you have 65 take home, apply 35k to debt. So now you're a doctor in their mid 30s most likely, making 30k and still in 465k of debt.

cquh2t0&rupaulsdragrace&godiego&"My stance:

1) Song choice and lip-sync style *definitely* matter. As soon as that country song came on in season four, I knew Chad was sending Latrice packing. Kenya is an example of this. She can kill those upbeat, pop songs, but as soon as A Natural Woman came on, Latrice snatched her so hard. Hell, even Malambo no.1 is an example of this. There was no way that Jinkx was going to get sent home on a song she could sell as funny.

2) This season just doesn't have strong lip syncers left. With Kandy and JDF gone, the only strong lip syncers left are Kennedy (assuming it's an upbeat song and she's not in a gown) and Katya. Violet *might* be able to turn a lip sync, and if it's a campy song so could Ginger and Trixie, but other than that, you're not going to get Laganja-levels of dancing.

Ultimately it was an underwhelming lip sync, yes, but it's also not like Pearl and Miss Fame are among the best lip syncers nor is this even a season with a lot of dancers and lip syncers."

cquh2t2&relationships&blackbirdblue&"your post is about you, but I'm going to write about me. 

I dated this guy for almost two years, and I never felt like I was in love with him. He said it every once in a while and I know that it hurt him that I wouldn't say it back. I really thought maybe there was something wrong with me. I spent quite a bit of time thinking about my expectations of love and relationships. 

I looked at my own behaviors and realized that I wasn't really committed to the relationship, he was pretty good to live with, he treated me well there wasn't any real discord. I just realized that while he filled a role of companionship there wasn't any real emotional intimacy. 

I broke up with him. He moved out. 

About 4 months later I met another guy, it was completely different. I fell in love. 

Here are what I found to be the biggest differences:  
I am invested in his happiness and well being, if he's not happy, I'm not happy.  
I want to spend time with him, and if I don't see him a lot during the week, I miss him.  
We share our goals and inspirations, and it's important to me that he knows about the decisions I make and why I make them, and that he shares in decisions that affect us both. Even if he claims not to have an opinion.  
I care about having good relationships with his family, even if they occasionally drive me nuts.  
Basically, I care more about how he feels and less about how I feel.  

Just my thoughts. "
cquh2t3&worldnews&mathcampbell&"At the end of the day, the only thing that ever really changes the world is the power of the people.

Even in instances where massive governmental pressure is brought to bear, ultimately it is because it has the support of the people, that it happens.

Case in point, the US occupation of Japan in the 1940's, which they privately expected to fail - they thought there would be massive riots, civil unrest, constant rebellion etc.

No, there really wasn't.  Because the Japanese people were sick and tired of their old government's bullshit, sure they weren't fond of these big vulgar Americans, but it was better than the military junta before....

Only when the people of Indonesia are properly pissed off, motivated, and sufficiently empowered to do so, will change occur.

cquh2w8&Windows10&DethFace&I do not need google. I know exactly how these systems work. Its actually what i get paid to do. Yes the Messages app that you speak off does deal with text but the method of delivery is completely different. Regular SMS (appearing in green bubbles) does flow thru the carrier's infrastructure  but iMessages ( appearing in blue bubbles ) use the devices data connection to contact Apple servers and then filter the message back down thru the internet and to the recipient. This has literally nothing to do with the carrier except facilitating the network connection. Sending iMessages will actually still function if the device has no SMS functionality with its carrier contract or is cut off from the carrier completely. This is also why this feature functions on iPods ( no carrier involved ) iPads ( carriers only optional ) and Macs. Skype comes in because it functions in the exact same way except that its not limited to only one company's products. If you still feel like you need some kind of validation in you dial up Applecare and any run of the mill phone jocky can explain the same thing to you. Or if you prefer you email me at my personal work address I can provide several very easily accessible and more reliable sources directly from my employer.  k_henry@apple.com. Good day, Sir.

cquh2we&swrpg&ScooterinAB&"This is a actually one of the reasons I don't like combat rounds and strict literal interpretation of skills. I have a story and a recommendation.

First, story time. I ran a speeder race as an interlude for my group. I wanted everyone to be able to participate and I wanted it to be more that ""make a whole bunch of piloting rolls."" So I allowed the players to substitute other skills in place of piloting, provided they could rationalize it. For example, at a certain point in the race, firing the onboard blaster would have just as much bearing on their ability to stay in the race as holding down the throttle would. Likewise, making a vigilance check to cut someone off can be just as valuable as knowing how to regulate your speed. By allowing different skills to be used, I got the party thinking on their feet, forced them to explain their actions, and allowed them to make skill checks that they might not have had a chance to make lately. Taking this kind of approach, you can allow the non-pilot, non-gunner characters to act in and affect combat.

Now for the recommendation. Read and use the one-roll resolution rules. These are awesome, and I kind of want to run an entire game using only them. These not only help you end a scene that might be dragging on while keeping things exciting, but they also let everyone directly impact the resolution of that scene. Everyone gets one action and the success of that action prevents damage of other problems from occurring. So whether you are in the pilot's seat, firing the quad laser, jamming the comms, or making everyone a congratulatory drink, every single person has a direct impact on the outcome of the scene. And that's pretty cool."

I doubt the telco (telstra, vodaphone, optus etc) has a deal with a jewellery store as it's not really target marketing if you're male. It's likely you have a recycled number and the previous owner of the number had signed up for promotional material.

You can opt out of most SMS campaigns by replying STOP, however if the promo campaign doesn't have an OPT OUT clause at the end of the message, give ACMA a call and keep the message."

Like Glubbi explained, a healer getting high ranks is usually the result of either less healers, slacked healing, or something was dealt with incorrectly which caused an unusually high amount of damage and required more healing.

However, if you do manage to obtain a high rank, you should still be happy with it! It shows you're *capable* of putting out high enough numbers to keep people alive, or at the very least keep going long enough to kill the boss. Just don't try to grab those ranks by forcing every bit of healing out there and hindering yourself later in an encounter."

They were also horribly overplayed, much more so compared to any other album release they've done.

I thought you actually had something worthwhile debating. Sad to see I was wrong."
cquh341&PurplePillDebate&PetticoatRuled&"First of all, trp is not ""men"". Trp is a very small subset of men.

Second, trp claims that its a safe haven for men who are upset with the state of women. But I what I see in the trp forum is both new and old members of trp saying the worst things about women and no one corrects them. No one is leading the battalion. 

If you wandered into a forum of all women and saw things like this (that went unchallenged), what would you think? I have seen the male versions of the things below in trp, and I'm going to phrase them as though a woman is saying them from her perspective:

**""Powering through LMR is a thing.""** (The female version)

*Men don't really know what they want. If he has last-minute resistance to say, having sex without a condom when he knows you're not on any contraceptives (and you really want a baby), you just have to apply techniques to loosen his resistance.*




**""Sexual strategy being amoral means that morals don't apply to dating/relationships/sex.""** (The female version)

*Sexual strategy is amoral. You shouldn't rape a guy or get physically violent but everything else is open slather. I'm plating four chumps right now. They all think I'm exclusive to them. It's okay to tell a guy you're interested in a relationship with him and then just hump him and dump him. It's okay to ask for expensive jewellery and trips away while you know you really think he's a chump and won't be staying with him very long. All single women should do it. It makes you feel more like a woman because you get all that male attention and you get gifts too! When it comes time to husband-up a guy, ladies (a hot, worthy guy - not one of your plate chumps), then don't breathe a word of your past. Make it sound like you've only have two LTRs. Make sure you used a fake name and ID with all your previous chumps.*


**""Red pillers refuse to leave women alone.""**

???

**""Red pillers feel entitled to sex.""** (The female version)

*Men who jump on the vagina carousel are disgusting slut-boys. Who wants their used-up, mangled penises? I want a man who is able to keep it in his pants. I want a man with the best possible sperm to have children with - not that mutation-infested over-30 junk sperm. All the best looking men are going for the hot women. Here's some evo psych studies on it. Sexually-hypergamous men is what we women have to deal with. Let's have a mutual rage session. It's why I can't find a decent, hot guy to date. Because they're all after the hot women. Ok, girls, let's go out and get the best plastic surgery there is and trick men into thinking we're hot. Men hate our group because we're trying to trick them. They'll only realize we were actually ugly all along when they have our ugly babies.*

**""Red pillers attempt to control women.""** (The female version)

*All men are children and need to be led by women. We need to make the important decisions for them. Amirite, ladies?? I've been upping my levels of dread on my husband all year. So far I've trained him to do the laundry, wash the floors and give me oral until his face aches. He was a really good boy last Monday and gave me a back rub without asking. So as a reward I told him we'd go to the movies on Friday night. But he's still not showing enough enthusiasm when he gives me oral. I'm thinking of upping the dread even further. I'm going to start flirting with X in front of him and if that doesn't snap him into line who knows what I might be forced to do next. What do you think, girls?*

**""Red pillers are sexually aggressive.""** (The female version)

*I tied up the guy I dated last night and then sat on his face until I came. He struggled and couldn't breathe but was okay with it in the end. I do this to all my dates. They're all okay with it and you should do it too. Show them you're a real woman.*  (This one is a direct analogy of an rp user who said he forces his penis down the throat of all his dates and throat fucks them until he comes, and that all men should do this. This went unchallenged.)

**""Hypergamy means wanting to date your best option.""** (The female version)

*trp say women are realists who pretend romance to get the best guy they can (hypergamy) and that men are romantics who pretend to be realists. Well hey now, let's exploit men for all we get. Because we're always trying to exploit, exploit, exploit. It's what we do. It's who we are. Meanwhile, why are women who know nothing about our grand unified theory of men snapping up men? What do they know that we don't? Quick, women of our mealy-mouthed group, to the bat-mobiles and out to conduct field reports!!!!*

And I say this as someone who has a history of warding a *lot*. 

It's just not worth it to pay the same amount for this little blob that I would for an entire character revamp."

You can buy Crew Credits from the PS Store to buy cars with, though Pvp racing is lucrative (not matter your placing) and kind of fun at times. Upgrading cars is done by doing Skills found around the game-world. Advancing the story is not necessary, I have not finished it. The only perk is, well, perks.

cquh35z&thisisthewayitwillbe&NanoStuff&"If only SLI was that effective in the general case I would have put out the cash for such a system. I recently got a 970 for ~300 and unfortunately there is nothing beyond this that makes practical sense, at least not for anything other than intently tuned applications of which there are few. I'm prepared to pay 4K or more for a machine if there was something to buy.

A titan X is 3x more expensive for 1.75x more performance, and SLI is no better, taking into account scalability, frame rate uniformity and the nasty unavoidable latency that comes with independent frame rendering.

Path tracing would ultimately likely solve these problems as it is much easier to concurrently render a frame and merge the results, yet the problem persists with physics calculations and general computing.

It will be interesting to see if NVLink somehow improves upon this with conventional applications but I'm not seeing much here besides higher bandwidth which isn't even vaguely a limiting factor.

The only architectural solution to this appears to be GPU stacking. Memory stacking is arriving in less than a year likely, but logic stacking is a whole other issue. Who ever manages it first would get an immense quantity of cash from me.

At 10nm a quarter-petaflop system could be built for $5000 with stacked logic. This demo would look like 1999.

By the way that comes to around $20 Billion for a Zettaflop. Some rich folk could comfortably afford such a thing. Imagine the universe simulations on that thing, never mind rendering. An Exaflop is low hanging fruit at this point; Grandma's pacemaker level computing."

I could say that I decided not to use the needle any more because of getting hep c and getting cured and dealing with that and the shame from it with my conservative foreign family but the thing that really seems to stick is the never ending pain of losing my best friend to a speedball in 2009.

He stood for so much and was such a shining beacon of light that I don't think I could do it again, it would be spitting on his memory and life. I had already been clean for 5 years when he passes but I can't stop feeling that it was the needle that killed him. Heroin has never taken that much from me before but it took my brother from another mother by way of IV. Ugh. Life goes on and on but I wish he was still here.

cquh3c4&smashbros&Jason_Seaver&"Ness and Lucas's proportions were changed from *Brawl* to *4* to be taller and less big-headed, so it's conceivable that while Lucas's head was scaled down as a whole, the bones for his hair didn't necessarily scale the way they wanted them to in accordance with his new model and they're still working on that. That's probably the last thing you want to bother with because you can get it done on a finished model in one go, but any tweaks to the model might make you have to adjust the bones again.

https://classicsmashers.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/untitled.jpg

It's not the best screenshot but here's a model swap I found on Google and you can kinda see what I'm talking about with his hair's bones. Bones are finicky and if the model isn't properly rigged, bones can deform polygons in unintended ways. Lucas's skull caving in when his hair moved would probably be a bad look for a trailer, so they might've just left it alone for now. Like Mewtwo's initial unveiling, Lucas is probably still in development, so there's still hope."

cquh3d5&SuicideWatch&JohnMalkovitchLover&"Even though you are going through all of this pain you still care for others, and that's very admirable. I am truly sorry that you went through such a tough time with your breakup and I know you don't want to hear speeches about how ""it gets better"" or ""you'll feel better with time"" because no one can guarantee that and life is hard. Sometimes I'm so exhausted with the whole thing I just want to sleep for a few years and not wake up. I hear you, trust me. All I can say is that I went through a terrible breakup when I was your age, and later I actually met someone who was much MUCH better for me, so although I can't guarantee that will be the case for you, I would be willing to bet on it because time is on your side. My mom left my dad after 35 years of marriage and he's single at almost 60... Now when he says he's lonely I don't know what to say, you know? My mom was it for him. Maybe this person you lost was it for you. I hope not. I hope you stick it out a bit longer and see what happens next; I know you're hurting and you're lonely but you can survive this. Just be yourself, you are kind and intelligent... Someone even better might just come along and recognize that. In any case, I wish you the very best. You deserve better than heartbreak."

I'd recommend checking the keto calculator on the sidebar to redo your macros. 

Right now you're aiming at around a 40% deficit. I'd recommend lowering that to 30%. You also need more protein for your muscles to stay healthy.

Try with these:

19/F/5'6"" | CW 176 | 40% BF | Mostly sedentary

* 1337 kcal Goal, a 30% deficit. (686 min, 1910 max)
* 20g Carbohydrates
* 84g Protein (64g min, 105g max)
* 102g Fat (30g min, 165g max)

Losing in the finals isn't a ding. It is a sign that you won your conference, and did better than 28 other teams in the league. 

I feel like the only reason we hold finals losses against players is because the greatest player happens to have none, and we assume that any characteristic of his career must be a positive. If the bulls beat Orlando in 95 and lose to the Rockets in the finals, is MJ's career somehow worse? He would have won more series, but losing in the finals would be a ""ding"".

Losing in the finals should never be a ding. LeBron carrying Cleveland through a terrible conference in 2007 and then being hopelessly overmatched in the finals isn't some failing of his as a player. "

For trans girls both the testes and penis shrinks in size, usually noticable in less than a year. This is also in addition to a decrease in sex drive and a changing of sexuality (not orientation in this case but the way trans girls are turned on). For instance I don't get erect without stimulation anymore (I'm a trans girl FYI), but I start flushing, getting hot and still being turned on (just not noticeably). I'm assuming in a few years the ability to get erect eventually dissipates."

cquh3j5&WritingPrompts&Kiwi62&"Dust and ashes. That was what they had left behind.

The Republic fleet had come fresh from battle. Over the fifth moon of Malachor the Mandalorian fleets and armies that had invaded the Republic had been put to battle, and destroyed. Destroyed at great cost, and with great brutality. Malachor was ash - less than ash, it was ruin, and the ruin of the moon echoed and screamed with the dark side of the Force, as the bones of the very earth were rent by a great weapon.

No rest, then, for the Republic victors. No triumph or parade across the Core Worlds. Straight from Malachor they had jumped, led by an instinct in the Force, out of the known galaxy into the peril of the Unknown Regions. 

On the bridge of the Interdictor-class battle cruiser stood Revan, the Jedi commander and saviour of the Republic. It was he who had spurred the fightback against the terrible might of the Mandalorian clans, defying a Jedi council who, wary of the currents of the Force, had ordered caution. 

On the bridge of the battle cruiser stood Darth Revan, Dark Lord of the Sith. So he had become. For in the horrors of the Mandalorian Wars all Jedi had learned two truths, forgotten in the long years of peace since the Freedon Nadd uprising. The first was brutally simple: suffering is the only constant in the galaxy. The heart of the Force might be life, but to live, to exist, meant to sacrifice. The second was even simpler: from emotions come strength. 

It was on sacrifice, not power, that Revan dwelt as his fleet exited hyperspace, a shadow alone in the light. He had sacrificed soldiers on Cathar, and on Dxun over Onderon, and finally, terribly, at the ruin of Malachor. All this he had done so the Republic could be made safe. 

He had sacrificed his innocence, too, when he took up the way of the Sith. For the power of the dark side had him trapped in a corner. He had needed transcendent might to beat back the Mandalorians, and prescient Force-led visions had led him to see that he would need still more to face what was ahead. So he had chosen the way of the Sith - with the sole mitigation that the darkness would fall slower for that he had begun it thus - with pity. 

""Looks like this is it, sir,"" came the report from the ship's CO, Captian Koray

On the main battle display the image appeared as Koray continued his report. 

""Medium-sized orbital station, shaped like an inward-facing ring. Self-contained atmosphere, and it's edge-on to the main planet - probably doesn't have too much to do with it."" Koray paused to check his sensors. ""Probes are on the way down now, but preliminary scans indicate a power source of tremendous capacity, far more than what you'd need for a station ten times the size - perhaps that's what you, uh, felt, sir."" 

Koray's service hadn't allayed his obvious scepticism in the more mystic aspects of the Force, but Revan let it slide - he was an excellent officer, after all. And the ring -

The ring filled him with fear. 

There was no reason why an obscure space station that wasn't answering hails should strike fear into a seasoned commander, especially one who was fresh from winning the galaxy's latest war, but there it was. It also didn't help that as he stretched out his perception, trying to touch the minds on the station, he felt nothing but a yawning, terrible hunger. No more. 

Whatever was on the ring was less than sentient, but more than beast. And it was hungry. Revan turned to the captain.

""Relay my order to the fleet to form up on the ring, captain. Analyse weak spots and prepare to fire.""

-will continue tomorrow."

When you're dehydrated, your body secretes [aldosterone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone) to maintain blood pressure by conserving water and sodium, with the side effect of wasting potassium; the low potassium is what causes the cramping.  I get cramps like this almost every day, although usually not this bad.

Lillard is already top 10 at his position, but LMA is roughly a top 10 overall player in the league. His skill set is unique and he opens up the floor, making it easier on all his teammates. I hope Olshey can bring back the core of this team, especially LMA. I suspect that some of the slightly anti-LMA sentiment I've seen lately is because people suspect he may leave and are bracing themselves for that reality.

cquh3px&WritingPrompts&ElpmetNoremac&"A staggered shadow crept across the floor as the early morning sunshine streamed through the windowpanes. The florist looked up to see a familiar gentleman pushing on the door as a soothing chime arose from the bell bouncing off its frame. She watches with a small smile on her face as he grips the doorknob in one hand and his cane on the other, trying to find support for his unsteady feet while crossing the threshold. He beams as brilliantly as the sun illuminates the milky wisps atop his head, lending him an almost regal glow. The florist chuckles quietly to herself as he crosses the checkered floor, admiring the displays that he has no true interest in.

Mr. Sherman arrived at precisely nine o'clock every Tuesday morning without fail to receive his order of two dozen gardenias for the week and place another order for the next. Not once had he missed a morning or changed his order in the seven years that he frequented the shop. Though she would not admit to such feelings openly, the florist dreaded the day that nine o'clock would come to pass without incident. She tried to bury such thoughts if only for the brief moments that he lingered within the store, though some measure of guilt always shone through.

“Good Morning, Ms. Marco” he said, hobbling up to the counter.

“Mr. Sherman, please call me Shirley” she replied, “and good morning to you too.”

“I'll call you that as soon as you stop calling me Mr. Sherman, my dear,” he responded with a smile and a hearty laugh that rattled his frame which made her laugh in return. “I believe you know what I'm here for.”

“Yes, two dozen gardenias, freshly cut” she answered, passing over the vase as the elderly man rifled through his wallet as he always did.

“Ah! Excellent!” he exclaimed, “She'll love these!”

The florist smiled warmly as Mr. Sherman walked away with the vase in one arm and his cane in another, whistling a contented tune. After he exited the building and walked out of sight, one of the newer attendants approached the florist. She tapped upon the shoulder of her boss meekly, searching for just the right words to say. The look upon her face was one that the florist knew all too well, a look that all of the attendants once had and she had as well.

“You want to know where the flowers go?” the florist asked.

“Well-I-” she stumbled, “Yes. I've never once seen his wife and he never speaks of her.”

“His wife passed away six years ago, long before you started here. He bought her flowers shortly before she passed, they were her favorites, ones that she came in and helped him pick. You could tell that it meant the world to her. So, every week from then on, he has purchased the exact same order and will likely continue to until he can't anymore” she explained.

“But, if his wife has passed, what does he do with them?” the attendant questioned further.

“I saw him once, you know? On my day off. He was at her graveside, changing the flowers and talking to her. I imagine that he does that each and every week. It's lovely, but it's kinda sad too, you know?” another attendant replied before the florist could respond. For the rest of the day, the three worked in relative silence as they thought about Mr. Sherman, his wife, and the orders.

**1 Drink if:**

Fans boo their team's pick

A player is called ""raw""

A reference to the player's 40 time is made

**3 Drinks if:**

A team trades out of or back into the first

A future pick of any kind is traded

The player's name is mispronounced during the pick announcement

**Finish your drink if:**

Somebody stumbles on stage

The player clearly does not want to go to the team that picked him

A team trades up from the bottom 20 to the top 5.

**Bonus Drinks:**

For every player left in the green room after the first round, drink twice for that player. If any players are left in the green room for the start of the third round, drink three times for each one."

Outside of the situation, he drinks a lot and seems to feel the need to always be out of his house. He's always *kinda* been like that, but it seems to have increased lately. So I can't exactly tell if it should concern me as much as it kinda does, or if it's just him.

In eastern culture, although they do have an honour code it is different, they beleive that it is fair to do anything possible to get ahead and if that means 'cheating' the system then that is fine.

cquh3uo&incest&[deleted]&"Yeah I came here because I was a little to excited for my own good to share this. The idea of being mostly anonymous finally gave me the push.

I was standing there for probably the better part of an hour. In my friend's borrowed thong set since I hadn't yet owned anything that revealing yet. The fact that he might have glimpsed me flashing in those videos or kissing my friends, things a lot of girls my age then did, didn't seem to unnerve me as much as the fact that I was in a thong a few feet from my dad and he was the first ever male to see me wear something like that. 

What I was thinking was probably, where was he looking, oh god he is looking at me, I can't stop shaking, or what my mom would do when she found out. She was always on my side and if I lost that, I thought that was worst than anything.

So yeah standing there looking at myself in the mirror trembling uncontrollably. Told him about my shaking and that I need to sit down but he didn't let me. I don't think anyone can understand the feeling of being so vulnerable standing like that for my dad. It was brutal, total mind fucking myself.

 It's been awhile so I can't remember much of any conversations. ""Why do you think dressing like a whore is fun?"", ""do you like how you look right now?"", ""We give you too much freedom in this house"", ""I'm doing this for your own good"", asking if my friends were the bad influence on me. ""Do you show the boys these videos?"" Everytime I turned to plead with him and apologize I was quickly turned by my waist pretty roughly.

In the moment, there wasn't a bit of sexual lust I have now about the memory, I was just terrified and compliant. Agreed to more than I should have and much more I should have said but didn't.

I can't read his mind so I don't know what he was thinking looking me over the way he was but I was very scantily dressed, so I just spent most of the time staring at myself avoiding eye contact through the mirror and keeping my knees from buckling under my nerves.

I think he was trying to lighten the mood when he made those stripper comments about me, a BIG FAILED attempt and my mind just stuck to that comment. Or I am giving him credit where it isn't due. Everything is in hindsight now."

cquh3wc&PoliticalDiscussion&imrightandyoutknowit&"Vaguely alarmist conspiracy theory aside, the budget of the United States isn't zero-sum, Congress could cut spending on the military and foreign spending and still not take that money and spend it on domestic spending. And vice-versa, they could spend exactly the same on foreign policy and just increase domestic spending. 

Just because conservatives *say* there's a limited amount of money doesn't mean it's true. The government can also increase revenues for all this stuff by increasing taxes on those that can afford it and by reforming the tax code like getting rid of some subsidies and closing loopholes. It's the policy equivalent of ""I have one of my hands tied behind my back so therefore I have one arm and can't do two-handed things."" 

Cutting military spending also doesn't necessarily mean that the government is going to be any less likely to use the military or declare war, not saying it wouldn't either but it's a matter of degree. As a major world power we have responsibilities to aid in world peace and stability when and where we can and sometimes that requires the use of responsible warfare. "

cquh3wl&CasualPokemonTrades&JUBlaziken&Sounds good! I've already added you when you're ready.
cquh3wm&anime&meteorMatador&"It's all about hype. The only way to get a score that low is to give the show a reputation before it airs and then disappoint the eager fans to the point that they write pages and pages of angry rants while openly weeping into their keyboards. So, the plan has to look something like this: Hire a cast and crew with a lot of marquee value to their names, blow the whole animation budget on amazing trailers, and then fill up the actual show with the sloppiest-looking garbage you can muster, right from the get-go in episode 1. Like fight scenes obviously written to convey all the action through visuals, but instead you get a total censor blackout, or thirty seconds of panup over some still image and you only know stuff is continuing to happen because you can hear the sound effects.

Now, that's just to get things started. Anime fans can be a hopeful bunch and it's likely they'll give you the benefit of the doubt on this one: You showed them those amazing trailers, so there must be *something* of value in this clusterfuck. The immediate goal now is to make them question why they ever thought such a thing. So the next thing you do is **start firing your celebrities**, as if it's their fault for ruining everything. Be really public about it. Do what you can to get it all over the news. Bonus points if you piss people off enough to start fistfights and everyone gets pictures of it. You see, at this point it's not just about one show being bad. When it's made clear that big name writers and directors had their time completely wasted for this total heap of garbage, that means *by proxy* that your show has also ruined other shows by taking valuable creative manpower away from them and flushing it down the toilet.

So by this time, everyone knows about your show, everyone wanted it to be good, and most of them are figuring out they're getting the opposite of what they wanted. Your biggest would-be fans have had their hopes and dreams destroyed. If you were clever enough with time management this should be happening right around episode four. Your only problem now is the people watching it for ironic trainwreck value, the people who laughed at the real fans' pure hatred, or found it thrilling. In other words, the Valvrave fans. So now it's time for phase three: Bore them to death, so even the ironic trolls will realize it's not worth their time. This is where you need a stretch of episodes where **absolutely nothing happens**. Push in all the stops and switch genres to something like romance/slice-of-life. (You **do** have a really cliched high school setting for this show, right?) You're gonna be following characters in real time on 10 minute subway rides when they're just going to the bookstore, or end one episode on a cliffhanger (*SOMEONE GETS A PHONE CALL*) and defuse all the tension in the next one (*THEY WERE JUST ASKING TO BORROW A LASERDISC*). Cut between badly drawn stills of people getting in the bath and people watching TV on their phones while they're taking a shit. And any time you have dialogue, stretch it out with awkward pauses and people unnecessarily beating around the bush to avoid discussing anything interesting, ever. This phase should take a *minimum* of 15 episodes, depending on what kind of airing schedule you've secured.

And at the end of it all, you throw out the most egregious of asspulls to reset the universe, undo all character development (what little you had, anyway) and set things up for a sequel that's all about the status quo."
cquh3wn&AskReddit&fuckincoffee&"In high school I was pretty good at making random noises and figured out how to whistle like a baby chick without using my mouth too much to conceal where the noise was coming from. I did it so often and kinda showed off in class (Idk why people thought it was cool) that one day we were in class, just chillin so everyone's just chatting away except recently dumped/socially awkward. I was whistling and over everyone in class the teacher heard me and snapped, ""fuckincoffee, if you don't shut that damn bird up I'm going to throw this freaking book at it!""

cquh3xl&rape&RFeldhake&"Hi OP, 

It's called a flashback, and it's a common symptom in survivors of trauma, from combat veterans to rape survivors.  I'd suggest you talk to your therapist about it, as they can give you strategies to cope with it.  

Do talk to them about this experience *even if you decide you're not comfortable talking about your rape anymore*, because this is the sort of thing that might happen again unpredictably if you experience a smell, sound or sight that reminds you of the event.  (This is where the term ""Trigger Warning"" originates.)  They can help you to understand what's happening and give you tools to get through it if it happens again.  "

I certainly simplified the issue, but my point is that the left shoots itself in the foot because it has problems cooperating. 

Also, the leader of the SPD at the time (Ebert? His name escapes me right now) was totally against the revolution and was happy that the Sparacists were killed. He loathed revolutionaries. 

And the USPD (the first major break from the SPD) broke off in 1917. "

End of the lesson we are using a van de graaff generator to screw around with static electricity and we ended up letting the kids touch the thing and get a small shock.

cquh408&todayilearned&[deleted]&"Ripped from somewhere:

Sparta has continuously been infamous throughout history for their military strength, odd societal structure, and daring feats of war that most people would call insanity. 300 recently popularized the city-state again, and while the movie can be called loosely based on actual events at best, Sparta definitely had the grit to back up their reputation. 

As Philip II of Macedon, the father of Alexander the Great, conquered all of Greece he sent a very clear message to the Spartans. “If I enter Laconia, I will raze Sparta,” meaning he would steal, rape, or kill anything that was left in the city. And faced with the most powerful army of the time the Spartans had only one word, “If.” 

Sparta then refused to enter the league of the Greeks to combat the Persians because they wanted no part in a league not headed by a Spartan. After Alexander’s legendary feat of destroying the Persian armies, he sent a very clear sign to Sparta. 300 suits of Persian armor engraved with, “Alexander, son of Philip and all the Greeks- expect the Spartans- give these offerings taken from the barbarians who live in Asia.” As it turned out neither Philip nor his son would ever go on to conquer Sparta.

* does not deal damage (maybe it is just because right now the short CD and long range make the free true damage poke appear ridiculous so it could be kept if other nerfs are considered)  

Then it would be a good engage tool for struggling melee champions or champions without real gap closer / way to get into the fight, without being an overpowered spell that makes all the tanks and bruisers impossible to deal with. And it would add counterplay, by staying behind the creeps for instance, instance of being affraid to be even near your own minions at any time.  
I loved playing tanks/bruisers in ARAM because I knew that even against a poke-heavy team you had a chance in mid-game team fights. It required to pass through the difficult early game, but it was possible to do something later on. Now if the good early of the immobile squishy carries disappear, ARAM simply becomes ""League of Bruisers"" which is pretty annoying..."

So I'm accepting that you've got better keepers, and Costa is better, and Terry is better than what we have to pair with Koscielny. Other than that, can't agree with a lot of your player comparisons.

Comparing midfields, Ramsey and Cazorla are better than Oscar and Ramires, no matter how you spin it. Walcott when he's not just back from injury is on par with Willian, so is Welbeck if we played him out wide. Fabregas v Ozil is an interesting one - I think we'd do better with Fabregas in our team than with Ozil only because Fabregas suits our team, however Ozil is the better player of the two in almost any other situation. Plus you can't compare absolute stats when Ozil has been out half the season.

As far as managers go... I think we can both accept that they would both be total failures at the other club."

Anyways, I have a friend right now who has put on about 30 extra pounds. He is getting fat. I am almost daily inviting him to the gym, but he keeps making excuses. His mother is heavy. I wish with every fiber of my being that it was politically correct to just comment on someone's weight like their hairstyle. Because it's almost that easy to change. Yet some people still are too selfish and lack the mental capacity and willpower to realize the mistakes they are making and change their habits.

This still does not change the fact that the knowledge not being available would end in more deaths. Not knowing the spell and method would result in more deaths while they practice and perfect it.

As for Nicholas Flammel, assuming the sorcerer's stone has the same method as in FMA then many people will also have died trying to perfect it, or copy what he did since it's quite clear he did not share the knowledge of how to make it with anyone."

Plus, if they actually *have* a number, the British citizens in question have almost certainly been identified and relatives/friends are very likely to already know their loved one's fate. Also note ""leading number""; I agree that it's relevant to mention the number of countrymen killed at some point, but focusing on said number is weird and has happened on BBC several times.

I can see the impulse to downplay how these foreign tragedies and lives are treated, but the legacy of imperialism is *way* too strong for Britain (or other Western powers) to pretend they're just worried about informing family members via broadcast of nameless numbers on BBC. The fact is that local, presumed-white lives are considered significantly more important than others, particularly when the others are presumed non-white."

Looks great. Pretty practical for what it is. Also I prefer the electric PS to hydraulic (that's dinosaur shit IMO). 

Bad: Brake dust. Stereo crashes a lot and does weird things (but it's still very cool most of the time). No projector headlights in the US. Gas mileage isn't as good as I'd hoped or advertised, but I have a tune which I'm sure effected it.

Overall: an incredible DD and fun weekend car. If you want something sporty and FWD, it's a maniacal beast. Light years better than anything else as far as I'm concerned. "

cquh47e&nfl&Intrinsic_Factors&Normally, they just get distracted or antsy. Everyone has things they're doing before the snap. The QB and center are making protection adjustments. The QB is also changing the play or the routes or the gap the run is through. Each linemen is focusing on how he can get inside/outside leverage The crowd is cheering as loud as they can to distract them. It's a lot to keep up with, especially as you get tired and it can be easy to forget whether the QB said the snap count was 1 or 2. And the O lineman is trying to get the jump on the 300 pound behemoth in front of him. Against guys like JJ Watt, you need every millisecond you can get

I do have to agree.  Though, I like thinking of Seven as Data's future.  The episodes where they both gave way to 'offspring', you can see the vast difference in their characters there.  I'd have to pick Seven because of that reason, that she is Data's future."
cquh47k&videos&Shazbote&"A black kid wearing a hoodie 99.9% of the time will have no problems walking through a white neighborhood.  I can't say the same for a white kid walking through a black neighborhood.  

I find it hard to believe that all these stereotypes and racial profiling views we have of any race or culture, are 100% formed by the media.  I think sometimes black culture doesn't see it's own racism against others.  Stereotypes might be the harshest and shittiest versions of what the actual truth might be, but there usually is some small version of the truth in them, as a general rule. That doesn't mean they apply to everyone, but that's life.   

Also I didn't say it was fair that it's on black culture to change this perception, but it is the truth IMO. What can white people as a whole possibly do to stop future riots like in Baltimore?  What can white people do to not think they'll get beat up and robbed walking through black neighborhoods because they're white? You're right racism IS very pervasive in this society, but it exists on all sides.  The racisms of white people fuel the racisms of black people, which further fuel the racism of other white people.  It's a circle of hate and I don't know that realistically it can ever be stopped completely other than everyone taking responsibility for themselves no matter what race they are. (good luck). And bringing their kids up to do the same. 

Finally, I just want to say I disagree with your examples of the ghetto vs cool dynamic.  People generally still think twerking and grills are trashy no matter who is doing it. Nail art, I've never known anyone to think that was a ghetto or bad thing.  And the colored and shaved hair, I think that comes down to individual preference, but I really don't know one way or the other if people call that ghetto.  I always liked the half shaved look, personally."

Anyway, 'what-ifs' aside, I was just pointing out that Sanders in 2015 is not in the same position as Obama in 2007, and has a much steeper hill to climb to get the nomination. "

The fact is, every company does this, and I bet it has more to do with the way it's packed than how it's handled. There's always a risk when shipping fragile stuff. I just prefer the USPS because they deliver faster, more days. They have more planes and trucks that end up delivering shit to pretty much everyone in the US, six times a week. UPS Ground means it never goes in the air, whereas I feel like if the USPS has room on a plane, they'll do it.

cquh48h&soccer&spongish&One win should see us safe. A favourable run-in with four games to go against lower half of the table teams, with some of our better players returning from injury/suspension. We've lost 7 on the run and if we don't pick up any more points in the next four games then we quite rightly deserve to go down. A relatively smallish chance of being relegated but it wouldn't surprise me if it did happen. If we stay up, next year there needs to be massive changes in terms of manager, playing staff and in how the club is run overall, ideally with Mike Ashley selling up and getting the fuck out. Overall, very disappointing season due to dreadful management from the top.

Stuff like this is interesting to me, I'm not an app developer. On iOS or Windows Phone, when you build an app, do you have to write a line to include the bouncing animations in your app's scrolling lists, or does it happen automatically anywhere in the OS that scrolls? Since Android doesn't have this bouncing animation at an OS-level, I'm just noticing that it looks like devs may have to implement small stuff like this ""on their own"" during the porting process as well, otherwise why would MS have shown a video demo in which the bouncing is absent?"

The nigger was simply followed to ensure he didn't steal or destroy something. Sure that was stereotyping. So what? It's called being smart and playing the odds.

cquh4g8&videos&nobodynose&"Yeah, that's a very vague term and it was intentionally vague because obviously there's no numbers.

I probably should use the term ""significant""?  Whatever term you want to use to mean ""unavoidably noticeable"".  What I mean but substantial isn't that most of them are like that.  I mean the population of people that would do that isn't small enough to pretend it's just an anomaly.  

For example if there was a white guy that murdered 10 kids, that's a very very very tiny portion of the population of 30 year old white guys so you can say ""that guy is just crazy.""  Now if 5-10% of white guys murder multiple kids, then that's a small population but substantial?/significant? enough to fuck up our perception of white guys.

Hopefully that helps it make more sense?  It's like the Muslim terrorist thing.  Most Muslims aren't terrorists.  But there's a ...(whatever term you want to use)... population of Muslim terrorists; enough that you can't pretend they don't exist."

After he told us about this, this girl raised her hand and asked if people walk side ways when they have to high of insulin levels.... this isn't even the most stupid thing she has said.

Now, I'm straight, but for the sake of argument, if I were gay and I were to enter into a relationship with a man, I would be ostracized from my Catholic community. The choice becomes staying in the Church and feeling alone for the rest of one's life, or leaving the Church.

It's not an impossible cross to bear, but seriously consider the position many gay people find themselves in, and you can get an idea of how heavy it is."
cquh4gt&politics&BankofStokes&Word.  I respect your opinion as well, but I think the idea of the Feds forcing states to make their minimum wage x percent of the average wage (across all industries/occupations within that state) satisfies your desire of a big government stick solution as well as lessens conservatives disdain for big government one size fits all solutions.  If government mandate minimum wage be 25% of new york state medium income of 51k per year then NY states minimum wage would be 14777 per year.  25% of Alabama's medium income of 42800 would be 10,700.  Minimum wage will always suck, and I just googled median income of New York and Alabama, rounded off, and picked the arbitrary percentage 25% , plus I had a drink or two after work so math be hard right now, but I hope you get my point.  The Federally mandated floor Minimum wage should fluctuate from state to state, county to county, city to city in order to account for differing costs of living instead of large population centers dictating what every place in the US should pay in minimum wage.

cquh4i6&serialpodcast&JackDT&"Jay did get burned telling facts that were later contradicted by alibis.  But he kept iterating on the story.

For example, in the first on-tape interview (already after the long off-tape interview in which the police said his story didn't add up), Jay said that Adnan got the call from the police while they were at McDonald's, not Cathy's. Then whoops, Cathy was interviewed says she saw the call at her place.

Next interview, call took place at Cathy's.

Jay had a lot of shots to fire and did in fact miss with a lot of them.

Another thing to keep in mind is that when Jay is being questioned, he's brought in because the police suspect Adnan.  That context would suggests quite a lot about Adnan's possible alibis to the person being interviewed, at least, that they weren't trivially verifiable because the police are looking into him."

Ignoring its inception as one of joke in Alison Bechdel's comic strip [""Dykes to Watch Out For""](http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/the-rule) (as that doesn't invalidate anything), let's take a look at its parts.

In order to pass the test, a film (or any text, really, in my opinion) must fulfill three criteria: 

* It has to have at least two women in it,
* who talk to each other,
* about something besides a man.

I can very much get behind most of these, because it seems silly that so many movies don't meet these basic requirements. Using this a tongue-in-cheek yet still totally valid metric for showing that there is indeed an issue with the film industry seeing women only as supplemental characters. 

Where the test becomes bothersome to me is similar to my gripe I have when it was revealed that Sweden was implementing a Feminist film grading system which, for as much as I can tell, is just seeing if a [film passes the Bechdel Test](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/27/swedish-cinema-bechdel-test-works) and not much else. It doesn't necessarily show the individual films worth even in a feminist context.

I remember back years ago cracked ran an article with a bullet discussing how a film can easily pass the Bechdel Test. It's example I believe was the Dead or Alive movie, which to me just seems like an excuse to watch scantily clad women get hot, sweaty, and do martial arts. That film passes with flying colors despite it being more interested on bikini butt shots than any sort of characterization. On the other hand, Run Lola Run would fail miserably, despite Lola being one of the most fully fleshed out female characters in film. Gravity would also fail hard, despite focusing on Sandra Bullock's character alone the majority of the movie.

Essentially this post isn't even a refutation. More of an annoyance of taking a valid concept (macro scale film industry) and trying to use it where it has no point being (micro scale individual films).

Humorous aside: I had to critique a short film script written in school by another student (years ago, not in the same class). There was a single female character in it whose sole purpose was to ask the sheriff to investigate her missing husband. We decided to remove her as she felt like a character whose only purpose was to be there to say ""look here! we have a women in the script."" As the film was set in an, I guess 1800's, coal-mining town, it would be difficult to maintain the current story (which revolved around the mine and not their homes), keep its accuracy, and add in another woman somewhere with enough plot around her to have a name and be involved in something to warrant not mentioning the missing male miners. We could cheat this and have them have a short conversation about literally anything and have someone name them as they walked into the room, but that would have been super indigenous and (in my opinion) seems MORE demeaning to women than just saying ""this is a movie about a situation were mainly men were involved, and we are okay with this. To make it anything else means we just make another film""."

cquh4lz&WTF&ladyhelena&"Yeah you should try that. I pick at the skin all over my body when I'm stressed. As far as I understand it, it's the same chemical process going on as cutting. So when a person cuts during times of high stress, it releases dopamine and serotonin in your brain-making you feel calmer. This does the same thing, and both can be very addicting. (Source: LOTS of therapy) There are lots of things you can try to divert your desire to pick at your skin. For me, I will wash my face with a wet towel to acquire some of the same sensation as picking. Just as a caution, none of these techniques should be abused. You wouldn't want to scrub your face until it bleeds or is raw. Sometimes I'll also hold a piece of ice in my hand. The burning (before any of my skin is numb) helps. If I'm tempted to pick at the skin on my arms or legs, I'll instead itch them (without damaging the skin, of course). I'll also try putting on some lotion. If it smells good, then that is a factor in relieving some stress, and massaging my arms and legs helps also. I really hope some of this helps. I know how embarrassing it can be to tell people about this. I have weird little scars all over my legs from picking and I don't usually wear dresses or shorts because of it. But there is help for this sort of thing! And you aren't alone. I will say though, that this kind of condition doesn't go away on its own. In my experience, it only gets worse. But Hang in there. :)
TL;DR- The sensation created by picking at your skin to the point of bleeding releases the same chemicals in the brain as a person who cuts themselves. There is help. Lots of coping techniques to use. I know your pain, bro. "
cquh4m0&AskReddit&igardenalot&"Most respect for people who give a shit. Least for those who don't. There are clearly people who go through life actively making a difference in their own lives, as well as those around them. They wake up in the morning with a plan to get shit done, even when that shit is just the basic stuff. They are actively engaged in the world around them. They're always thinking about what they're doing.

Then there are those who just subsist. Yeah, they get up but they just drag themselves from activity to activity. They half ass at work, they come home and stare at the TV or the computer and they get up and do it again. At no point are the thinking of a way to do something more. No goals, no to do lists, they're just alive. "

I have not a recurring dream, but a recurring place. I have a whole dream city where most of the dreams I remember take place. This city is entirely fictional as it is sometimes a little whacky, but it never changes layout or anything. It is a consistent ""solid"" city.

It's by the sea, it has big mirrored skyscrapers that give away to seaside town. Further you go it becomes jungle.

Yesterday I dreamt about the mafia that runs ""my"" city. It's super weird."

cquh4sl&Boxing&TysonGOAT&"Who the fuck is advising Pacquiao financially? He's spent the majority of his expected purse so far.

Expected income for fight: $120,000,000

Expected taxes to pay on purse (35%) -$42,000,000

Top Rank's cut after taxes (27%): -$21,000,000

Freddie Roach trainer fee: -$8,000,000

New Home purchased in LA for family: -$12,000,000

Tickets for the fight: -$3,000,000

That leaves him with $34,000,000 and that's presuming Top Rank takes their cut after taxes which may not be the case. That also doesn't factor in Koncz fee, other training fees, etc. That is a huge chunk of his purse, that's great that he is generous but he needs to look out for his future as well.

They are a former client of mine, and my team built their website and the tech that leverages an Amazon API to allow these young folks to register for the things they need to get their adult lives started. Think of it as a gift registry for adulthood.

Over the last couple of years it has been amazing to watch these young folks in need go from zero to fully sponsored.

I'm not connected to them in any way, but it is some of the work I am most proud of having done.

Then they start grading you on how well your interpretation lines up with the one your teacher thought up....

but this right here was one of the big ones that held me back. 

my style of booking is pretty conductive to going fast, i pretty much only book 2 promos a show, run no storylines, i cheat alot using the editor ahha, and i use autobooker to book all of the REGULAR show's matchesthen just going through picking winners, because i noticed if you don't have really awesome road agents, yo match rating goes down the more notes you give it.


then PPV's i go all out and shit with the big gimmick matches and people meeting up to fight for titles.

it takes me about 1-3 months to play a year in TEW 2013, thats with 2 shows a week and 12 pay per views a year, also i spend a SIGNIFICANT ammount of time messing about with pushes at the beginning of every month.

if i really grind i could do a year in a week probably.

cquh4xd&TheRedPill&the_red_scimitar&"As one of the elder statesmen here, I'm going to chime in. Being RP (and not just faking it, or just copping an attitude, but actually fully establishing yourself, your frame, and your lifestyle), an interesting point is that I can pull plates from their early 20's to their mid-50's, and when I mention it here, know-nothing under-30's spew some drivel at me about the older ones with, ""ewww... they're the bottom of the barrel"". You can hear the pussy in their tone of voice.

A man, well established in his career, finances, lifestyle, activities, interests, fitness, education, and so forth - THAT man is going to eat a 20-something's lunch as regards interest from women, in many situations where age isn't necessarily a part of the activity. Now, you can be that man in your 20's, but it's rare. You can be that man in your 30's, and these days, that's also rare. 

So, I don't think it is age, per se. It is that utter confidence that comes from success and experience, all of which sums up to that old adage: *know thyself*. 

If you also know RP, game, and know what you want, you may not be exactly unstoppable, but you are going to find it easy to pull hotties for whatever activity you want.

cquh4zk&nfl&Vikarious&GOODBYE MARIOTA RUMORS!
cquh4zl&GetMotivated&pface&"I'm a chronic procrastinator.  I always had good grades, but yeah, I had to fight myself for them. Here's my tips:

1. Accept that you're a last minute person. You won't ever be the type of person that starts their paper three weeks before it's due, and leaves themselves a week for editing and proofreading. It's okay! A lot of people are like that, and in the working world it's actually valuable to be able to do things quickly. 

2. Have a workspace. I have a desk that I use for work and projects only. If I decide to start screwing around on the internet, I leave the desk. I also have music that I only play when I'm working -- this helps a lot.  I'm considering getting a candle or incense that I only burn when I'm working, since studies show that smell is closely tied to emotion.  

3. Identify the emotion that is causing your procrastination. You may not recognize it, but there's something unpleasant you're avoiding besides just work. Trust me, procrastinators are not lazy people. Fear of failure/success? Fear of change? Boredom? Indecisiveness? I'm procrastinating on a paper right now because the topic I chose turned out not to be as good as I originally thought, and I'm mad at myself for choosing a bad topic, and feeling hopeless about getting a good grade on it. Believe it or not, it's a relief to know that, because then I can do some positive self-talk and get over it and move forward. 

4. Do only one thing at a time.  When you're feeling really pressured it's easy to jump around from task to task -- you read the first two paragraphs of the text, do half a practice problem, review the first half of the first day's lecture notes -- but it's all very superficial. Instead, take some deep breaths, and set one reasonable goal and finish it.  I find it's better to do something that's more active than passive -- doing problems, recopying lecture notes, copying formulas over and over.  It helps with the jitters.   

5. Manage distractions.  At work I use Toggl to track how much time I spend on various projects. When I get an e-mail, rather than jumping right into it, I take a second and decide whether I want to change my Toggl tracker, or keep going with my current project.  That tiny extra second means that I prioritize much better. And if I find I let myself drift into something else, I just refocus on the project at hand -- it's like meditating. Forgive yourself and move on. 

Hopefully some of these will be helpful for you.  "

Either that or they are just really polite about their friend's developmental years.

Generally I think the alter ego trend thing (not the alter ego mental illness thing) is a trend like those angular S's  where it doesn't have a specific known starting point but it tends to be perpetuated by people who have access to the internet. But not necessarily the english internet, as I believe there are some people who do it in China, where they have their own internet.

cquh50y&politics&christ0ph&"Bill Clinton got $600,000 from Achmea Health Insurance for one speech. Achmea is the insurance company that sued the Slovak Republic for voting for single payer and ti limit the insurance company's profits to 20 percent. The money was seized under investor-state clauses similar to the ones in the three pending TTIP and TISA and TPP FTAs. 

They seized approximately 20 million euros in ""lost expected profits"" from Slovakia's taxpayers.

Reminds me of Freud. He described patients he saw, I think while working with Charcot, about how some patients would get so hot that they'd throw themselves into snow in the middle of winter. 

And then more recently, something about Japanese Zen Buddhism, where a master was saying that you should be meditating so hard that you sweat. 

Makes me think of Dune, and the control of the body through awareness, for some to such a degree that you stop aging (and maybe become a giant worm).

cquh51e&AskHistorians&Hergrim&"I think you might actually have the Greeks and the Persians mixed up this time.

""Curiously enough the anticipation of Cyrus, when at the council of war he admonished the Hellenes not to mind the shouting of the Asiatics, was not justified. Instead of shouting, they came on in deep silence, softly and slowly, with even tread.

...

And now the two battle lines were no more than three or four furlongs apart, when the Hellenes began chanting the paean, and at the same time advanced against the enemy.

But with the forward movement a certain portion of the line curved onwards in advance, with wave-like sinuosity, and the portion left behind quickened to a run; and simultaneously a thrilling cry burst from all lips, like that in honour of the war-god — eleleu! eleleu! and the running became general. Some say they clashed their shields and spears, thereby causing terror to the horses; and before they had got within arrowshot the barbarians swerved and took to flight."" 
(Book I, Section VIII) 

I think it's also worth noting that it's entirely possible that the Persians deliberately withdrew and succeeded in separating Cyrus from his best troops: http://www.persee.fr/articleAsPDF/antiq_0770-2817_1992_num_61_1_1135/article_antiq_0770-2817_1992_num_61_1_1135.pdf"

cquh51k&badpolitics&CringingAtTheWorld&"Something reasonably simple this time.

R2:  I'll ignore the attempt to compare Canadian and American parties, and focus on the main mess: the rest of the chart.

* Why is a quarter of the chart taken up by communism, and how was the order of Stalinism, Leninism, and Marxism determined?

* Marxism is not a mid-left ideology.

* Socialism is not centre-left, and Norway and Sweden are more social democratic than they are socialist.

* Why do the Golden Dawn and Tea Party get a massive change of position with power?  What is the reason for that?  How does that work?

* This is the one that irritates me the most: The Golden Dawn is not some sort of Greek Tea Party.  It is a neo-Nazi party, and should be with its fellow Nazis.  Instead, here it gets treated as identical (in every way but the name, it seems) to the Tea Party.

I can't even figure out if that is meant to be a comparison of the Tea Party to Nazis, or a minimization of how extreme the Golden Dawn is (with its separation from Nazis).  Either way, it is wrong."

cquh51w&socialskills&staticgirl&"Um personally I'm not hugely interested in unfocused chit chat. Although that may apply to me more than the general populace. 

Personally I prefer it when people contact me casually if it is to discuss a mutual interest or explicitly to arrange hanging out in real life or something. I mean there is a reason I'm subbed to the social skills subreddit, I am no expert. 

I find it really hard to engage in a conversation if I don't have a strong direction to lead it in or the person contacting me doesn't seem to have any agenda.

If I wanted to talk to someone without a specific line of conversation in mind I prefer to say something like ""hey, how's it going?"" giving them the opportunity to respond with the part of their life they would like to discuss whether it be work, school, relationships, emotional state, hobbies or other interests. 

When someone contacts me out of the blue for a general chat in order to sustain our relationship I prefer it when they say something like, ""hey have you seen x?"" x being perhaps a cool movie trailer or something relating to a mutual interest.

I am rambling. 

TL;DR: When it comes to pointless conversation try to make it broad and able to be focused by the person you are talking to, or better yet lead with something to talk about that you will both enjoy. Really not an expert, might be terrible advice."

cquh538&fantasyfootball&Canadaismyhat&"Lmao 'professional gambler' that doesn't understand managing expectation in fantasy football. 

9 man lineups don't reward depth. Your team can have a trash bench, and I can have studs on my bench due to my knowledge gained from hard work... yet that has zero impact on a week to week basis without injuries and byes. In 20 man rosters I get to predict and marinate on 4 more names instead of having to drop players I knew about from the beginning to some schmuck who had no clue who they were the week prior. Last year I already had ODB and CJ Anderson on my bench, which took a lot more  skill than stumbling upon gold on the wire. Speaking of the wire- please tell me YPL at least does FAAB and not some flukey worst to first slingshot free agency (FWTFSFA)?

Lastly, you can't play for high stakes in YPL. Go ahead and grind if you want, putting in 2,000 (8 * $250) and taking home what, 3,000 on average if you're very good (10 players, 1 in 10 chance of winning if you're exactly average- but your strong fantasy work ethic makes you 3x more likely)? 

I spend hundreds of total hours preparing for and managing through the season, $1,000 for that much hard work is not exactly going to get my blood pumping. That's like $2 per hour, and money won is supposed to be sweeter than money earned. 

I certainly agree that auction significantly increases the skill factor. Unfortunately it also eliminates almost all the lesser skilled players, as people that auction are much more knowledgeable on average. "

Be real. You can't rely on aim to get out of a rank. I get 4ks on the rounds where I don't forget to check corners, where I don't run through smokes, where I don't get flashes, where I don't get prefired. But that is not every round. And every single one of those players out skilled me without out aiming me - positioning, nades, gamesense, anything.

He corrected me, said I was wrong, when I know I am right - because my aim is NOT good enough to net me 3ks as consistently as I can on pistol rounds. Yet I still get them, every single time. I retaliated by giving actual REASONING as to why it works, why I am right, as compared to him saying, effectively ""because that is the meta"" as reasoning."

-Since a no so long time ago you said in a interview that in the third album will be ""more pop, less rock"". what made/makes changes your tests enough for do differente music? is that an individual experience or what?

-What do you think about Mark Ronson put you on youtube like a collaborator in ""Daffodils"" when actually, you are the singer and higher collaborator of the song?

-What do you think about Argentina? Do you know it? (not only Buenos Aires,of where i am not from)

-And the last question: What are the music that do you hear now? do you hear pond? do you like the Nicholas Allbrook's music? i do

cquh54v&australia&davo112358&I agree and would champion the cause in terms of education and vocal opposition to what I see as animalistic behaviour.

cquh550&gameofthrones&Cheimon&"I think Bronn really did give him the opportunity to yield, though.  [Check this video at 2:35.](https://youtu.be/NN30YMzja6Y?t=145)

For about 15-20 seconds, Ser Vardis has his sword arm stuck in position by Bronn, and Bronn looks up expectantly at Lysa Arryn, as though she might be about to call it.  We get enough time to see the reaction of several people that the fight is obviously over.  Ser Vardis just sits and waits, and then gets killed for not yielding.  

With Brienne and Loras, it would have been insane not to offer a more explicit opportunity (although even in this example, it's implicit not spoken).  Loras was an important ally and the King's brother-in-law.  "

cquh55b&Indiemakeupandmore&SUBARU17&"Well, I'm going to add my own gripes.  
Once upon a time, I loved Moonalisa products. I don't typically finish jars or bottles of anything; I tend to open to sniff, use once or twice, or give away sealed boxes of products. I actually finished what I ordered from Moonalisa and would buy more to replace them. I wrote glowing things about her stuff, and I loved posting on her Facebook page's wall.  
This past winter/spring (end of February), I placed a sizeable order with her. The TAT is supposed to be 30 business days, which would be around April 10th. I just received a notice today. Other customers still have yet to get theirs. A handful received their orders a few days ago. She gives these excuses *every time* that the shipping company she uses is busy or only ships on certain days. Well, I theoretically think TAT means from production to receiving a tracking number or notification of your order shipped.  
But anyway, only reason I didn't file a dispute or ask for a refund (as I suggested others to do in another comment) is because I was willing to wait. But damn, I don't think so many people should have to wait *that* long. "

i do not and could not relate completely. i dont think any white person really could. but i empathize and i feel sorry for the folks who are protesting peacefully and being overshadowed by the bad apples of the crowd. i think the vandalism, the looting and the riots are indicative of thuggish behavior. its thuggish when white kids do it too, just because their favorite team lost in the playoffs. at least in this situation the protestors are airing actual and legitimate grievances, but it doesnt really justify this level of violence. maybe instead of looking at the people's skin, we should just look at the action and say ""ok, theyre obviously stupid and doing things they shouldnt be doing""

there are leaders in this community, both black and white, who are finally gaining a powerful platform to talk about the real problems and i dont want those people or our city to be negatively impacted by the actions of a select few. there are too many cases of police brutality coming to light now a days and it shows an imbalance in the system. that should be the focus of everyone's conversation. not his possible pre-existing conditions, or his arrest or whatever. thats my two cents at least..."

The guy had like two other kids already and I think he went to jail. 

The girl actually became a bit wild after she had and kept the kid. Hosting a drinking party at 11am on a school day (my sister was her friend and they actually ran from the cops when it was busted) was her low point, imo. She eventually had another kid a couple years after her first but at least it was conceived consensually with someone her own age. "

For the comment below, Tangerine is fantastic because it's so simple -- in fact that's where the title of the book comes from. If you're not investing very much then the MER is not going to have a huge effect.

For the comments above about emergency fund and what-not, I think risk tolerance plays a part. Let's say that you do need the money in the short term after all for some reason, and that your timing is terrible and you need it in the middle of a 50% market correction. Would you be ok taking the loss and withdrawing the funds? For myself I know it's unlikely I will need more than what I keep in liquid cash, so I invest the rest, but there is still a chance I could have to dip into invested funds in a prolonged job loss or some other real emergency. And I'm ok with that, I've worked it out in my head in advance. In your case, with the emergency fund and your other sources of support, you'll probably be fine investing a portion, just don't tie yourself in knots in the future if you do need to take it out and your investments are down."

cquh59e&IAmA&Kwnicol&"Since no one has answered this very explicitly I thought I'd fill in the gap for you.


I can't speak for Vince's reasoning, but I interpreted the blue meth as an ode to the main Pseudo cooking method during the rise of methamphetamine called ""The Farmer Blue"" Cook.


This cook is a 1-step reduction of pseudo ephedrine to Methamphetamine, using Anhydrous Ammonia and believe it or not LITHIUM! It's a redox reaction (I believe) but was large in Indiana (where I'm from) because how readily available Anhydrous Ammonia is due to our Farmland. Lithium ion in solution caused the solution to turn a deep Royal blue, thus the name of that cooking style, and My interpretation as to why the meth in BB was blue.


Source: I'm a Chemical Engineer from the former Meth capital of the U.S. and my Orgo teacher loved to use meth as an example.

Of course you can still ask what it is about those that led to the masculine/feminine distinction being retained in English and it's a very legitimate question (which I'd answer for you if I had any compelling explanation, sadly I don't).

When you do business in a community, you ought to be hiring from within that community when possible - it's the best way to run a city and economy.  Otherwise you end up in an untenable situation that takes money out of the local economy instead of recirculating it.

Edit: a legitimate gripe doesn't justify looting.  It does justify and explain feelings of anger and resentment.  If a shop won't hire your kids but is hiring kids that live in a different neighborhood, that leads to resentment."

The economy goes through cycles, regardless of what individuals do and what has happened in the last decade was the fault of financial institutions - not baby boomers. My qualification for saying that is I am a financial services risk manager. I get what went wrong, and it wasn't down to a generation it was the fault of a system which didn't work, and a few who saw that and took advantage.   What the baby boomers did did was to take advantage of a world they thought was better - where good pension provision and other financial (and social advantages) which had previously been seen as the preserve of the privileged became available to all. If you want to criticize them - and I am talking about my parents here so I have skin in the game - what the working class individuals of that generation have been ""guilty"" of is naivete.  They thought the progress they saw in terms of redistribution of wealth and progress in individual rights and gender equality was unstoppable.  What has become clear is that it wasn't."

I used to suffer from this until I frequented some more obscure subs (Shout Out /r/dwarffortress!) that I realized exactly how different the article and content pools we drew from daily really were.  

While /r/thebutton has garnered a moderate amount of external media, it certainly hasn't 'gone viral' to the degree that even some moderately successful youtoube videos have. 

Mainly because redditors don't often cross-pollinate their media source pools. Well, besides reaping likes off facebook from last night's /r/adviceanimals frontpagers.

I realize it's only been five years since high school, but you should definitely give some shorter lengths to see how you do. I disagree with trying to run 16 miles when you've never run it before and your bone strength/muscles haven't been up to the task in a while. Do a 5K today, a 10K in two days, another 5K in two days, another 10K in two days. If you can get through that battery, you should be able to move further up. The thing is, even though you've been lifting, it's still a lot of stress on your bones, which is why training programs don't recommend a 10% gain in distance week over week.

So, see where you're at first, then move up. Only you'll be able to determine that and you'll need to be as honest with yourself as possible."

cquh5d2&lost&AntiIogical&"With a few replies already posted, I was totally expecting someone to say Boone. His death was so tragic, the first of the main castaways to die. Looking at his character alone, it was so sad: only trying to help out the group, and specifically his ""mentor"", leaving behind a sister who depended on him (and though she was becoming more independent, their platonic love had grown in the weeks on the island). But the effect it had on everyone else - we get to see an extreme example of Jack's relenting dedication and the strength of his hero complex, we see a glimpse of all of Locke's anger that was hidden under the surface until that point, which would go on to shape his own journey and eventual demise. That was arguably the breaking point (either this or the journey from the Black Rock) between Jack and Locke, where Jack realised ""we're going to have a Locke problem"". Then Jack's absence from Claire's birthing meant so many other character bonds being strengthened, whilst that juxtaposition between the giving and taking of life on the island made the death all the more shattering - and when we see the birth of Aaron again during the flashes, in the back of our minds is a reminder that past Locke is pounding on the door of the hatch, Jack has just finished transfusing his own blood into Boone's arm whilst continuing to treat him, and Michael is preparing for the possibility of amputating a leg. It was such a pivotal moment across so many characters and brought out so much in them that we would see over the coming seasons (i.e. in many cases, the rest of their lives). If I have to choose a death as the most ""well-done"", not just tragic or dramatic, that wins out on so many levels. "

cquh5dk&learnpython&nwilliams36&"Firstly read the reddit guide regarding how to post code so others can read it (hint look at formatting help button)

OK you have the main menu.  The next step is to work out what you want the user to see when they press 1.  Code this section until it works the way you want.

Then move onto what happens when they press 2 etc

cquh5ds&researchchemicals&[deleted]&"well I feel better but fuck that shit. that was one UGLY MOTHER FUCKING experience.

my sense of cold and taste are completely different then I remember. Bananas have this nasty taste, ice feels like it did when I was like 11 years old, gatoraid has this nasty hint of piss...

I did burn my lungs good with Cl2 gas 4-5 years before, perhaps the opiate withdrawal resurrected some dead cells or something, idk. pepperoni tastes funny too, and toasted bread has a odd smell. 

all i got was clonadine. I did not taper (though like 36 hours in I took 1mg in an attempt to get to sleep, it did not work, so I got rid of it, i decided tapering was just gonna extend the illness. 

fucking drug bullshit

my parents got involved and I got some serious anti drug sanctions going on, like zero tolerance, probably for the best though, I have had enough fun for a long time. I feel guilty for spending the $ on drugs too, I would have preferred to work on a project or visit a certain someone.

5 years of bingeing on various chinese chemicals lol... god damn."

cquh5e7&AskReddit&merthsoft&"Sometimes poop is way worse. Like, if I say ""there's a bunch of shit on my desk"" one assumes I have a messy desk. If I say ""there's a bunch of poop on my desk"", one assumes I have literal poop on my desk."
cquh5e8&gaming&greatzimkogway&Third to last kid is right, though.  Compared to what we have now, it absolutely is a piece of junk.  Battery guzzler, pisspoor screen, pisspoor sound quality.  Only good thing about it was the durability.  Just because you're nostalgic for something doesn't mean it's not become a piece of junk as time goes on.  Because its only use now is nostalgic gaming.
