cqug90s&makinghiphop&KingEze&Your 16 bars seems to focus on introducing yourself rather than a life you think is worth living. I understand if you introduced yourself in a few lines that made sense to the theme such as the line “I fear my life remains aimless, I traded paper for a lane switch.” That made sense to the theme because it could be used to tell the audience how you don’t have a life worth living (yet). But lines like “If you fight me, I'ma show hands and throw down on yo ass like the young motherfucking Sylvester Stallone has” has a place for introducing yourself, but not for the theme of a life worth living.

I shot my dog. I had him for 10 years. I can home from partying and it was New Years so I was going to shoot off my .40 so...

Well I was loading it outside and I shot it off accidentally. Right into my dog. Me having about 5-7 tequila shots into me though if I go to sleep I would wake up and he would be okay. Well if I called a vet when I shot him I could have saved him. Or at least from his pain. So I woke up saw a dead dog in my yard… i cried for hours. That old dog still had a few good years in him.

cqug91n&AdviceAnimals&backwoodsofcanada&"That's something you hear a lot from people when discussing huge builds like this, especially with new vehicles.

For starters, the interior. Heated leather automatic electronic cooled touch screen activated everything, most guys don't want to do a crazy overhaul on their interior and if you have money to burn (this is a hypothetical dream build after all) why not get the one with the fanciest interior?

Then there's the fact that the Rubicon trim level comes with a bunch of required off road kit. Lockers, heavy duty axles, and an electronic disconnecting sway bar to name a few... these are all features that any self respecting modern off roader would have. So, you could buy a Sahara or well equipped Sport for like $35K then spend 20 grand (or better) on axle swaps, gear swaps, skid plates, locking differentials, etc, voiding warranty, or you could just buy a stock Rubicon for $45K that comes with all that gear from the factory. In the long run it's just cheaper to buy the Rubicon if you plan on doing a serious build.

cqug91p&videos&BurntTheToast&"Because we aren't responsible for the actions of our forebears?

We should help these people not because of some race karma but because of love for your common man. 

And we've tried. We give them advantages by giving them things like affirmative action, diversity quotas and scholarships that white people (even ones as poor or poorer) don't get. They don't want change. 

The black community has lashed out against a problem for which even they don't have a solution. 

What do they want from us? To abolish police and law? To remove punishments for black crime and release black criminals? To force white people to not leave a neighborhood when black people start moving in (and as a measurable consequence, an increase in crime)? 

The cause of their problems lie in two places: 

The actions of a misguided ""community"" in which individuals use race as an excuse to commit more crime

And individual prejudice inside of every day people who collectively make life harder for them. 

The former of the the two possibly being a consequence of the latter but I digress. The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime. It only makes more racists. And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level. 

How do you change the mind of the individual? I'm not completely sure. Nobody really is. If black rioters/criminals started taking responsibility for their actions, made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity, white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies. 

Because when something is so baked in to your consciousness, being a person isn't enough to earn a chance to not be hated, you need to give people a reason to not be racist towards you. (and I'm not saying this is how it should be, it's just how it is) "

I have one DLP and BBM in my home tactic and a BWM and a DLP in my away tactic. Meyer I play Attacking Mid so he contributes more to the defensive side of things. One WB on my home tactic and 1 FB and 2 FBs on my away tactic. 

I had to get another good midfielder so I bought the two Romero's, bought Silva for the LB, luckily their front 4 are all great starters including the back ups so I haven't had to buy much there. "

cqug92d&anime&anweisz&"I can see how that could easily go. People often rate for enjoyment. When you're at the end of that show you can be like ""Aw it's over? That's how they end it? Oh well, I guess it was good throughout the season. 7... or maybe an 8"" but then you go back and think about it a little ""Hmm why did I give it a 7 again? Yeah I liked the char... wait I didn't like the characters, they were all douchebags. There must have been one... Aoyama? And fuck the whole thing was frustrating. Fuck! Why did I like it again? ... I can't come up with anything. Now that I remember it was a terrible show, fuck! It's not even a 6, the whole thing was so shitty... more like a 4!""

I wouldn't count that as overanalysing. It's just that when the art and the characters are pretty you can forget and forgive a show for many things without realizing. Once this guy remembered the show was bad and there weren't more episodes or cute art to keep him distracted he gave it a more honest personal score.

Of course all of this is probably overanalyzing on **my** part but it probably went somewhat like that."

cqug92t&tDCS&redidtsmith&"Very low level, subtle mania.  From my coworkers reactions I'd guess it's just efficient zombie mode.  What I notice more often is that I'm physically tired.  Still alert enough mentally.  Dumb typo mistakes from my mind has moved on but the fingers are left to finish up the words.  Last night I get maybe 3-4 hours sleep.  Waking up kind of sucks, but when I first wake up, the brain fog lifts right away.  The next today (today) I'll go to bed earlier.  That means I'll wake up in the middle of night.  Once awake, wide awake.  But I know to wait and eventually fall asleep again or my sleep schedule is even further off.  Since I got more sleep, I can stay up a long time the next day.  And then on the weekends I'm ending up staying in bed, dozing or sleeping until the afternoon or evening.   

Memory consolidation I still wonder about.  Am I not remembering as much if I sleep less?  Is my brain processing everything faster than normal, and it just doesn't need any extra time?  In terms of time having extra hours in the day is nice.  I get more done.  And that's translated into spending more time at work.  $$$  In terms of quality, it's kind of blah.

Police officers routinely see the worst that society has to offer, and it's easy to lose yourself in the mess if you don't have the right coping mechanisms set up.

If he never introduces himself, he may never get the chance. They might not know the same people, or go to the same events, or anything. So what does he do in that case? Because by what you're saying, there is nothing he can do. So why not just introduce himself? If she finds it weird, then that's on her, unless, like I stated earlier, he makes it weird.

Equally important is that every EIO conduit uses a base of Conduit Binder, which you can craft in large batches. In essence, you can subtract two steps from every EIO Conduit after the first time you make a Conduit."

Some of us here (including myself) see TPP than just ""oh we're only 1000+ random people"". A lot of us got to know each other, joke with each other and learned from each other. I got to known a few good people I some day wouldn't mind getting to know better (if I had that type of time). So yeah it's like what we do here (in terms with sparking conversations with each other) but other at another place.

cqug9cv&CarPlay&slowtop1&"As someone who just installed an AppRadio 4 (as in literally just installed it yesterday), I think it's probably a little premature to jump in. 


I'm happy with the AppRadio, but I was coming from a factory radio with no Bluetooth or any other features.


I think it's too early to tell if the glitches are Pioneer/Alpine issues or if it's on Apple's end. I have little respect for the software development skills of either Pioneer or Alpine, so I'm inclined to point the finger at them. Once OEMs start installing Carplay we should have a better idea.


Speaking of OEMs, once we see Carplay in factory systems I think Carplay will start to offer more apps and features. I don't know how Carplay apps are added to existing apps or are vetted by the App store, but they're being added at a snail's pace. Based on the lack of Carplay units on the road, it's hard to blame app developers for not making their apps Carplay compatible.


Unless you have a need (I need Bluetooth for hands free), I would suggest holding off for a few months to see how this plays out."

When you struggle in practice, take a moment to focus on one element of the exercise at a time. Just make sure you can play at that tempo. Then make sure you can hit the strings in the right sequence. Then fret the right notes. Then put it together.

cqug9er&GoTRPcommunity&FlippinMuffins&"Hello guys, I would like to establish the Kingdom of Sarnor on the rp at some point (whenever I get a free character slot), but it was recently on my mind and I thought it might be good to iron out some details before that happens. So, time for the history mumbo jumbo.

We assume that the Doom of Valyria occurred around 105 BC and directly after that commenced the Century of Blood that swept through Essos. During this time, the Kingdom of Sarnor was decimated by the Dothraki, almost completely slaughtered after the Field of Crows. The Tall Men were driven back to Saath and numbered only about 20,000 after all was said and done and the Century of Blood was over. We'll say it's been about 500 or so years since this point to where the rp is now. My point is to figure out a rough estimate of the current population of Sarnor (other Dothraki raids notwithstanding and can be calculated into the total when all is sorted). 

I've done three calculation for you mods to decide between.

* 5% Birth rate (A generous number and the least likely of the three, but I figured I'd throw it in) would leave the current population at 500,000 in the year 505AC
* 3% Birth rate (Average, more akin to the birthrate seen in the world today) would leave the current population at 300,000 in the year 505AC
* 1% Birth rate (A somewhat low number, but could be completely understandable if factoring other wars and raids into the figure) would leave the current population at 100,000 in the year 505AC

Thank you for reading this little bit! As I said before, these populations do not take into account various other raids or catastrophes that might have happened. Also, I understand this sub is about storytelling and not about hard numbers and the like, but I feel having a mod approved rough estimate of the population would only be a good thing for world building in a civilization that was once destroyed. Thanks!"

cqug9fg&sex&tablechairfloor&"Really like it! I was kind of surprised when my bf first asked me to do it, because I couldn't imagine it being very enjoyable for him - but apparently he likes it when he almost can't breathe? I think it feels so good, so I get a bit nervous that I'm getting a bit carried away when I start to grind (which usually escalates to me basically just thrusting myself against his mouth as hard as possible) but he'll always just push me off a bit if I get too into it, takes a few breathes, and then pushes me back on. I like it when he's laid down and I'm squatted onto him, facing his body because then I can usually attend to him with my mouth and hands whilst he does that, haha.

when i first logged in, I saw the new island on the map and went straight there.

Why wasn't i getting any continuation quests to other parts of the island that i hadn't been to?

eventually i googled AOM to find a writeup on what all there is to do in the expansion and low and behold, there's a starter quest in freeport. As if i'm supposed to find that organically.. "
cqug9ge&AndroidMasterRace&Blunt_Wizard&"I'm am explicitly not saying one is better over another they both have different uses depending on data and power requirements.

Yes over a mile IS best case, clear conditions, minimal interference, etc, BUT seeing around 4,000 feet average is doable, the antennas are only 100$ a piece, and are around the size of a nexus 7 maybe a half inch or so larger, don't remember, so no, not expensive equipment, just a simple antenna.

Infact there is an xda post of someone who soldered the same antenna to their WiFi antenna inside their nexus 7 2012 and crushed a world record for farthest WiFi controlled drone flight including the own companies best results lol

cqug9gi&GradSchool&DockingBay_94&"My university's grad division is causing a similar type of language requirement debacle right now.  Grad students in my field are required to complete a foreign language requirement (either via undergrad diploma, or exam in the appropriate language department).  Foreign students however, cannot use their native language (say, Korean) to fulfil this requirement, nor can they use English (which for them, is a foreign language).  

So essentially, grad division is requiring students from non-English speaking countries to be trilingual.  "

You could declare a variable equal to currentTime -q. Then another one equal to that -1. getAttr -t will give you the value of an attr at a certain time. So do two of those at the different times you established and subtract them from each other. If the result is positive the value is going down and vice versa.

Thirty years ago was 1985. Back then current technology included encyclopedias, phone books, glove-compartment maps, 640 K RAM and phones stuck to the walls, with fifty foot cords on the handset if you wanted mobility. The year end top 100 looked like [this](http://www.oldradioshows.com/at100/1985.html). We were half an hour from complete nuclear destruction at all times. Terrorists were Irish and East German, and it looked like South Africa was going to be under apartheid forever.

It's important for someone to say that it's not your GF's fault, but don't bring it up unless she's mentioned that she's feeling that way because otherwise it may be unnecessary.

cqug9l8&polyamory&glittalogik&"On a good day? Every few hours. On a bad day, pretty much non-stop to varying degrees.

It's a complex beast. There's a combination of ingrained responses and values that I'm actively working to overwrite, past hurts that don't really get erased by logical counterarguments, the standard battery of subclinical brainmess (self-esteem, anxiety, codependent tendencies etc.), trust issues, communication issues, jealousy, envy, fear, and a sea of unknowns and uncertainties about the future, my relationships and my own feelings, desires and hypothetical responses to new stuff I'll probably have to deal with sooner or later.

But at the end of the day, I chose this and I'm fucking going to make it work.

I've had to experiment with various responses and strategies. I tried to dial back my emotions and care level but it was erratic at best, and constantly fighting myself like that was exhausting.

I've tried opening up and being completely honest and communicative of my feelings and that was even worse, because there's way more stupid whiny petty hurtful shit in my head than anyone else should have to deal with, and I wound up regretting a lot of things I said and instantly wished I could take back. That's just not the version of me I want to present to my partner, or to the world in general.

At the moment I'm hovering around a slightly modified, hopefully more sustainable version of what you've described. I don't *deny* my emotional responses, but I do try to filter them, and force myself to take time to think my way through stuff before I say or do something I regret. Sometimes that means delayed responses or removing myself from situations if I'm not sure how I feel about them, and I don't always get it right, but I think it's helping. I'm working to keep pushing my boundaries and comfort zone, albeit gently, and to stay as outgoingly positive as I can without being insincere. Basically aiming for honest words, pleasant demeanour and trying not to make my problems anyone else's unless I have to. It's still a bit hit-and-miss, but I think I can get it right, and I know it's worth trying."

any good striker Bader cant consistently take down outclasses him on the feet, that would definitely be the case with Rumble, i dont know if you know this but Rumble has great Takedown defense; 85% and Davis couldnt do anything vs him, I doubt Cormier will be able to just lie on him, he might be able to take him down a couple times but its also going to be stand up fight and Cormier could actually win and would be a deserving champ unlike Bader imo

out of curiosity but how has Bader improved a lot? his striking is still not good and he relies way too much on his wrestling, his 2 big wins over OSP and Davis he didnt look all that good, he just outwrestled OSP which he cant do against the elite guys and vs Davis it was just bad stand up fight between 2 wrestlers which nobody won, the judges were just forced to pick a winner and 2 picked Bader"

It is very horse friendly and lots of places to unload ect. There are a small amount of bikers and hikers, weekends are busier of course. Pretty much any encounter I have had with folks there is great. Everyone knows the trails and trail etiquette and I've never had any issues. They do day passes or you can get a state park pass as well. I would highly recommend the area. Beautiful trails and not too far from town.

cqug9pe&vita&talkingwires&"If you're at the end of the game, you're most likely gonna need to do a another playthrough. Only a dozen or so of Rise's navigation lines are triggered during specific boss fights, and you're most likely leveled too high to pick up all navigation lines you missed. Here's some tips on how I got it:

* Play on Hard or higher difficulty. If you're over-leveled, you'll miss many of her lines.

* You will have to use all of the characters, there's no way around it. In your next playthrough, get to the top of each dungeon, exit, switch out all your characters, and start again from the bottom. Look for enemies that cause status ailments, and keep fighting them with every character until you've heard all the lines associated with that ailment.

* Don't guard or heal characters. Let them get knocked down and affected with status ailments. Each effect on each character has two or three lines associated with getting inflicted with each ailment.

* Don't level up your party's S. Links. Doing so will let characters help each other recover from effects. Rise has dozens of lines for characters recovering from ailments on their own.

* Do level up Rise's S. Link as fast as you can. The lines she says about enemies' weakness at the beginning of each battle count. She also has many lines for when she helps you in battle, including taking damage for you and recovering knocked out characters.

* You can try scanning every enemy you fight, but there's no clear consensus whether those lines count or not. I did it anyway.

I got the trophy in the Hollow Forest on my first playthrough, but I was actively trying to get it to pop. Some people get lucky and get it without trying, but I've heard of others doing three or more playthroughs and never getting it. Do everything you can to trigger lines, and you shouldn't have a problem."

My base commission is $500, which is high considering the volume that can be sold in a day, but I upsold the customer to $2000 more than the usual $200 upfront cost. 

That $2000 was all my profit. So that's about the commission from 5 sales. 

The company has since eliminated the up selling option because of that sale. "

When I was coming out to important people and it was new and a big deal, I needed to hear that it was okay. But if I'm at a party and being introduced to someone and they find out and do the speech, that's when it gets annoying. I never meant that my friends and family weren't allowed to react like that during the initial coming out situation. That's normal.

cqug9qy&insurgency&smgunsftw&To be honest mods can go both ways, as they can make players easier to spot in some environments but harder to spot in other ones. For example multicam shows up more in desert maps, but hides well in forest settings. Another example would be pmc skins, they make the player easier to spot due to a lack of camo, but also makes it harder to tell if they're enemy or friendly. 
cqug9qz&MadokaMagica&Rob__T&A lot of the characters are very off in the dub.  Homura comes off as emotionless, which she is distinctly not in the Japanese track, and Kyoko sounds like Angelica Pickles, which is VERY off from her character in Japanese.  Madoka's voice actress comes off as more irritating than she does cute, and you can tell that's what she is trying for.  The only decent one is Sayaka, and that's still several levels below the quality of her Japanese counterpart.

But in terms of presentation he was never a great sell, same as Myerson. Nadella and Belfiore have the presenting chops to be more plausible ~~footmen... ah duck it done typing on this shot windows touch keyboard and shut reddhubb app, ill find my android tablet and finish this post~~ frontmen. 

(phew, back on a usable small-tablet keyboard / reddit app)

The only thing that's changed is the perception of those guys at the top, which is important for your regular joe - like the OP, clearly - who judges by how plausible someone looks. It's why Yahoo has Mayer as CEO, it's why a legion of US corporates are headed up by sharp-looking dudes in their 50's, and it's why Apple wouldn't have been the Apple it is now without Jobs. Bald, bug-eyed Ballmer with his sweat stains and strained nerd voice wasn't going to cut it as a frontman in this hyper-self-absorbed age however good his leadership skills were. And they *were* good despite his misses. 

Nadella has only just started putting his own stamp on the company and is currently riding high on Ballmer's legacy.

What you get out of school is a combination of what you put in, what others put in, and the materials or intelligence among those involved. Case in point - I hated math at a younger age, until I found a teacher that had a disposition that nothing you could say or do could make her mad. She LOVED algebra and she loved teaching. If I had had more teachers like her in my elementary math classes, I would probably have loved math previous to her.

cqug9v0&Homebrewing&pumblechook&"I just bottled my dry hopped saison yesterday! Granted, I've only tasted the hydro sample, but it tasted pretty bloody magnificent. Recipe:

    8.5# Belgian Pilsner
    3# Flaked Rye
    .5 oz Mosaic @ 30
    .5 oz Motueka @ 15
    1.5 oz Mosaic @ 30 min hop stand (started chiller 15 min into stand)
    1 oz Motueka @ 30 min hop stand
    1.5 oz Mosaic - Dry Hop 5 days
    1 oz Motueka - Dry Hop 5 days
    Wyeast 3711 (1L starter)     

ABV: 5.4% (OG = 1.048, FG = 1.007)

The sample was super tropical fruit - lots of pineapple and mango, with some earthiness and other exotic-tasting fruit that I can't place. I'm hoping that the yeast and rye spiciness will come through a bit more, but if not it will still be damn tasty.

It obviously depends on what you're going for, but unless you want a tropical fruit bomb, I'd use one of Citra, Galaxy, or Amarillo and pair it with hops that have complementary, but not necessarily similar flavor profiles (Nelson would be good). I actually used those three hops in an IPA, and it was just a muddled fruit punch flavor. My experience in using hops with similar flavor profiles is that you have to be damn good with your hop schedules to get them to play nice together instead of becoming muddled.

I've had good luck with apple trees (craft an apple) combined with fern seeds from the fossils mod (they only grow under trees, but grow fast).  I did also make the trees artificially taller by planting them a few blocks up, and then filling in underneath with logs (I thinks it's prettier).

For my carnivores, I have pigs in with them.  Duncan could set up a little pig farm next to each pen with a chronotyper embedded in the wall to sort pigs into the enclosure.  Or just move some in with a lasso.

And of course, all of this would have been a lot easier if Duncan actually knew how to hand feed them!  Right click with an appropriate food, and it feeds and heals them (no need for potions).  He can use the Dinopedia to check what they eat.  Admittedly, I've had trouble doing this with full grown T-rexes, maybe because of their size.  But I've had no luck with feeders or tossing food on the ground.

Best of luck!"

Experimented with adding UV to the pearl-ex, but its not nearly as crisp and decided against it.

For any faintness: its printed using a high-quality printer and gives *very* consistent results. Might be a subjective thing. All the reviews say its the best OH UV by a landslide and ther's not much I can do to improve it.

cqug9xa&marvelstudios&w3djyt&"In my foray into the professional world, I've come to realize that no one really knows wtf is going on at any given time. 

It's just my experience, but after watching companies run from the inside, I can say I wouldn't be shocked *in the slightest* that Marvel and Disney and DC and WB have no relevant research in this area. Quite a lot of the time, the decision makers go with ""common knowledge"" and ""their gut"" and don't even think of it in that manner. Hell, even if they did look for that kind of research, it's very likely they don't have it just based on the fact that they have always paid so much attention to marketing this stuff to boys. 

(For example, the medical field, and thus for things like dosage instructions on the back of medicine, for pretty much its entire existence ran on studies that were primarily made up of white men. It was only fairly recently that doctors - at least in the US - looked at things like diet recommendations and dosages and said ""hold up, why are we giving everyone the same instructions when there are very real differences to take into account here?"" That sort of thing happening in marketing as well isn't exactly farfetched.)

So, yes, ymmv, but as much as we'd all love these things to be logical - especially concerning business decisions, it's been my experience that it hardly ever is. "

cquga00&cheatatmathhomework&huloca&"He's not renaming the surface M2, it's an entirely different surface from M. M is the surface area of the part of sphere above z=1. This is however not a very nice surface area to integrate over, so we want to find a different surface area that is easier to integrate over. 

First, Stokes theorem is used to get an integral over the boundary of the spheresection, which is precisely the circle at z=1. Clearly, this is also the boundary of the disk at z=1, so we can use Stokes theorem again to get the integral over this disk, which is much easier to calculate.

First of all, the n in this case is (0,0,1), so we're left with just the z-part of the vector. Second, the area of a disk is easy to calculate, so the final calculation is made a lot easier as well.

To give some physical explanation for why this is allowed. We're calculating the flux through this surface. Look at the object created by also adding the disk. Every fieldline that goes into the object, also has to come out, and since the field is pointed upwards, every line that exits through the spheresection has to enter through the disk, so the flux through the disk and the flux through the spheresection are the same."

eta2: I really, really, really like this update. Though it doesn't progress the plot much, it's great that we're getting a moment where characters can just resolve all these fucking issues through communication rather than w/e alternative. It reminds me of the scene where all the Alpha kids were chatting on their sacrificial slabs. Things are really getting addressed. Actual attention. Fuck, I'm so primed for the next several convos."

The point I was trying to make was that I feel people are generally less tolerant of smoking then they are of something like car exhaust, which is equally dangerous and unpleasant.  I think that when talking about restricting social rights and freedoms, only the danger to other people should be taken into account.

I don't agree with the line of thinking of ""I'm willing do put up with the danger of X activity, because I do it or sympathize with it, but think that the equally dangerous activity of Y should be illegal, because I don't sympathize or agree with the choices of people who do that."""

cquga77&Calgary&kairisika&"No. It's not so much an active dislike so much as disinterest. The texture doesn't bother me, I just find the flavourlessness undesirable.  Mild cheddar to me is like eating chocolate cake with the flavour magically removed. Why bother?  I found the paneer similarly bland. It was perfectly edible, but didn't make me desire to eat it. The seasonings applied were tasty, but could have been better applied to chicken, where they blended and complemented the flavour.  
I guess it was somewhat like eating cardboard tikka. good seasoning, but the heart of it wasn't something I desire to eat.  

I don't eat tofu for a couple reasons, but since it's a similar soft, mostly-flavourless blob that you just apply flavouring to, I imagine I would find it similarly undesirable.  (I eat meat, so I have no reason to turn to tofu, and I figure there are enough soy byproducts in so many other things these days that I'd just as well stay away from eating big chunks of soy. the only tofu I eat is in shelf-stable TVP ground form when backpacking, where it offers significant advantages over meat.)

cquga97&pitbulls&SincerelyNow&"It sounds like you know what's best. 

Btw, you likely didn't fail him. It's very normal for pits to have prey drive and it's very normal for pits to ""turn on"" around his age. Turning on in pit bulls is becoming dog aggressive. 

My little bitch was at the dog park for 2-3 fucking hours, every single day, without fail from the day after her shots were done to about 9 months old. I took her to classes, I took her to stores, I took her everywhere. Didn't matter, little hot girl turned on at 9ish months and we had to stop dog park. She still has dog friends, but they're from her puppy stage and have established relationships. She gets on good with plenty of new dogs, but the 2% she wants to attack plus the 100% that she would never back down from and welcome a fight from meant no more dog park for the most part. 

You need to make sure that these boys are extremely clear on the fact that she's got extremely strong prey drive and also dog aggression. They need to verbally confirm that they understand that they cannot own another dog or pet while he's still alive with them. 

I think the fact you could go visit and also babysit is pretty cool. It's a unique opportunity that lessens the hurt of this decision. 

Lastly, I hate to judge you on appearances, but you seem like the kind of girl who's priorities in life are your social and night life. This is probably just about the worst breed to own for someone like that. 

Good luck with whatever you choose. "

cqugaa0&cripplingalcoholism&NotoriousBootyPirate&"Well. I was kinda tripping out when I wrote that, but luckily I can translate a good majority of BO me's philosophies. 

The eyes are the windows to the soul. The eyebrows are the drapes. Your eyes show what you're feeling on the inside, your eyebrows show your reaction to those feelings/ what you're feeling on the outside. So if you're in a situation you're being judged, just keep them flat and don't twitch or knit your eyebrows. They move a little closer together and ""knit"" when you are feeling anxious or judged, but if you keep them flat or slightly arched, you appear to NOT GIVE A FUCK GANGSTER AS FUCK LIKE OCEANS. 

BO me was actually talking about shaving them off. This would equate to *no emotions* being reflected off. So 0% judgement.

cqugacx&serialpodcast&clodd26&"There was definitely a plan in place imo. Adnan and Jay spoke briefly on the phone the night before. They spent the morning of the 13th together doing (?) I have come across theories that they could have been looking for a gun for Adnan to use in the murder. The Nisha call (Adnan made sure to put Jay on the phone even though he didn't know Nisha) and short visit to Cathy's house seem like an attempt at an alibi. Adnan was back at school in time for track. Imo it all went too smoothly for it to have been unplanned. 

On how close they were-I'd say they were probably just getting to know each other. Jay was older and more streetwise than Adnan, Adnan was a wannabe thug trying to impress him. Adnan flattered Jay's gangster image by asking him to help him, but I doubt Jay actually thought he'd go through with it. "

Build a station (train or truck, for example) and as you hover near the area you build, pay attention to the Acceptance section.

So saying ""this will/won't be in the SNP manifesto next year"" is complete speculation - even Nicola doesn't know what will be in it because she's not written it yet.  Surely she will have a great many ideas, but she doesn't decide the manifesto in a vacuum, there's people to be consulted, conference will probably make some policy etc....

cqugafz&news&snkns&"Lol.  That's my comment you're talking about.  I'm a public defender.  Exposing lying cops is one of the favorite parts of my job.

Telling people they're probably shit out of luck is a pretty common response in the sub, but that's largely because there are a lot of posts that warrant that response.  I employ a similar approach with my clients:  I don't sugarcoat anything, and I focus on what we *can* do.  Sometimes this is quite a bit, other times it's not much.  

I do agree with you though that snark, derision, and telling people they're wrong, happen more than necessary. Lurkers seem to upvote based on entertainment value, so judgmental replies can sometimes rise to the top.  I can definitely be guilty of some snark, but I always attempt to include helpful questions or comments alongside.  And sometimes you have to dig a bit deeper or wait around for something genuinely helpful.

[Here's a good recent example](http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/33oc2p/trespassing_charges_from_an_officer_for_crossing) where the top-rated comment tells the guy he's guilty, and then the guy comes along later on to say that he successfully fought the ticket.

But I'll stand by my statement to that guy - he probably has no recourse.  That's not the feel-good response, but it's the honest one."

cqugag5&IAmA&Holovoid&"I think Roose is more of a pragmatist and devoid of empathy. I don't really think he's necessarily ""evil"", he just does what he has to do. I don't think he took pleasure in the Red Wedding, he just realized it was do or die and the only way on the winning team was to betray the Starks.

Ramsay on the other hand is downright sadistic (e.g. actually derives pleasure from others' pain and suffering) and a complete monster.

cqugagj&AskReddit&hudspud&Most Americans do. However, the average media that depicts American geographical knowledge tends to do it for humor and targets unintelligent participants for the questions to display America in a negative light. Granted, I'm sure there are actual stats saying Americans are worse at geography but most people base their views of TV shows or Youtube channels asking Americans for their geographic knowledge. If its filmed in Cali, you're cherry picking.

cqugagz&Catholicism&FlameLightFleeNight&I don't think you're in the minority, but the problem with that is that good speakers with something to say are not the easiest to find. If it can be managed then great, but generally that'll be hard. The advantage of the video format, and Sycamore certainly works like this, is that the video is the smaller part of it. It works as the conversation starter and guider. You aren't going to a talk or a lecture on faith, but are having a meal with a conversation about it.

cqugah9&Music&AutoModerator&"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/introduction). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

My one regret from TH7 was maxing it completely instead of moving on when my walls were done.  Once you get to TH9 the bottleneck to completely maxing for 99% of players is loot.  IMO, as long as your farming troops are maxed you should move on once you can no longer dump excess resources right away.

cqugal6&CardWars&Vlyke615&"First thanks for this, and didn't realize the tourny gives out gems too. 

I was saving cards mainly for crafting/deck building seeing from your response I just need the high cards with the WWs, and the fact I can just farm the cards again I'll be dumping most of the cards.

The tournament I joined and am fluctuating between the low to mid 30s for ranking which is higher than I expected, so will be playing more of that. I lost about 20K in gold since I didn't see it cost money per search but it's so easy to come by I'm not worried.

That makes sense with Dr. Donut. There have been times I needed a certain field creature but they were either in the discard or deep in the deck. I'll start leveling him now. Then hopefully obtain Hunson at some point.

From there you'll need the direction vector from the sun to each point (X_arrow - X_sun? might as well convert to Cartesian here since you'll want it in the next step), and do a dot product manually using the U, V components. Once you have the value at each, normalize them to the 0,1 range and use a cmap to set the color of each arrow.

cqugamp&Psychonaut&StanShunpike&"As ""meat projectors,"" once our chemical processes shut down then we will simply be nonfunctioning matter, like a broken CD. The data might still be there but it is unretrievable and has no purpose. In such a world there is no true love or kindness, evil or hate, there are just chemicals and hormones incentivizing and compelling us to act in certain ways. Some people believe this is the truth because they think science is rational, and there is no objective proof that there is something else.

My personal opinion is the double-slit experiment proves that science as understood by humans is still mysterious, subjective, and incomplete. The study of art and humanities (and psychedelics) have probed human experience and come up with explanations far more beautiful and terrible than what science alone can offer. What's the harm in believing in that we could be experiencing something much more magical than we know?

As a species, we should encourage the marriage of science and art instead of creating a false division between the two. We must explore our spiritual capacities, in addition to the scientific laws that bind our universe. Both can be true simultaneously.

cqugaos&smashbros&poopstainpicasso&"I was a melee player since release of melee. Yes I'm an old man. One thing I highly suggest is randoming! Random a lot! You can always focus on someone later. 

The characters are not the same and first attempts to play them as so can be frustrating. Randoming really allows you to explore the physics and tactics of a totally different game.  I feel as though it helped me find characters I liked much faster including ones I never thought I'd like. Being forced to try everyone really opens your eyes to the fact that a crazy amount of characters are viable in this game and a fresh meta. 

Honestly many of the fundamentals translate. Bairs are strong on almost everyone and pivoting into them really increases success. Paper scissors rock is definitely a major aspect. Forcing people into pressures decisions is where the greatest players shine. Mixing up approaches is crucial. Predictability is death no matter how fast you are. Empty hops and jabs are your friends. 

TLDR: Keep an open mind and try lots of different characters/tactics until it ""clicks""."

cqugaqe&actuallesbians&i_am_a_meatpopsicle&"Pretty much what /u/Lluxx said. It doesn't help that the radical left has been getting progressively more and more radical as of late thanks to things like Tumblr and whatnot. In real life, amongst my friends and acquaintances, I would be considered pretty radical on a lot of issues, but in certain spaces here on reddit and other websites, I would very much be considered a moderate due to how far the left has moved.

Also, there's a small, but very vocal minority of people who identify as feminists or who are interested in social justice that use it as a way to bolster their own self-esteem by putting down anyone who isn't as radical as they are. A very holier-than-thou call-out culture, basically. When that's your first and main experience with feminism, it's not hard to imagine why someone would flinch at the thought of being lumped in with them and choose to identify with something else instead. I don't agree with it personally, since there's a lot more to feminism than the people bitching about nonsense on Tumblr, but I'm not surprised when people are turned off.

cqugaqo&news&tits_and_gravy&"It doesn't say it, but it can be inferred from the numbers easily. It said that 52.4% of hate crimes were committed by whites, and 24.3% were black. Whites are 77% of the American population, blacks are 13.2%. Whites are underrepresented and blacks are overrepresented in the hate crime stats. This is pretty simple math.


There are 5814 offenders

52.4% is 3047 offenders rounding up to the next whole number

24.3% is 1412 offenders rounding up to the next whole number


There are 245,532,000 whites in America

There are 41,600,000 blacks in America


We can divide the total number of offenders by race into their respective population totals and get:

1 in every 80581 whites was charged with a hate crime in 2013

1 in every 29461 blacks was charged with a hate crime in 2013


This makes blacks 2.73 times more likely on a national level to be convicted of a hate crime than whites, per capita.

cqugat0&NeoFAG&theadroitgroup&Evidence is racist!
cqugat1&Pathfinder_RPG&Killchrono&"Necromancy is one of those things that's been codified as 'evil' because that's just the typical fantasy archetype for it, but not without good reason. As the classic alignments go, 'Evil' is considered selfish, disrespectful, and dishonorable, and necromantic magic falls into a lot of those categories. Some of the chief reasons include the following:

* General respect for the bodies of the dead. Most societies value the symbolic gesture of putting their dead to rest (which is why a lot of the time when a person dies in war or execution in other countries, they go to great lengths to get the bodies sent back home), so even if the corpse is mindless, their relatives and friends wouldn't take kindly to it.
* It's considered a cheap and horrible form of psychological warfare. Imagine you're fighting a war, one of your close comrades-in-arms dies, and next thing you know they're raised as a shambling corpse trying to kill you. It might be effective but generally it'd be considered a pretty abhorrent thing to do to someone, both the person who died and their loved ones.
* Depending on the game and the setting, necromantic magic (and other similar kinds of dark magics) are innately corrupting, degrading either the caster's soul or body.
* On that note (and I think this is the big one), I believe under the standard PF setting, raising a corpse with necromancy anchors the soul to that body, trapping them in their shambling corpse until the undead body is slain (that's why in the Golarian setting, Pharasma, the goddess of death, abhors necromancy; because it's a perversion of the cycle and keeps souls from her realm). So the whole 'putting their soul to rest' shtick is quite literally freeing their soul from their body so they can peacefully go to the afterlife.

Obviously all this depends on the setting. It's generally codified that necromancy follows a lot of these conventions, but depending on the setting it may be considered socially acceptable, and the rules about corruption and soul-anchoring may not exist, so it's less abhorrent for the person who's body it was.

If the setting your playing in has all those conventions, however, there's not much you'll be able to do to convince other people what your doing isn't somewhat abhorrent. The act of raising dead bodies isn't going to be something you can really make anyone feel comfortable about, and all other kinds of necromantic magic is inherently about torture and suffering, so again that's not going to win you any friends.

From a player perspective, what you want to do is accept that's the case and run with it. Maybe your character is trying to prove a point that not all necromancers are evil while being ignorant to the social and technical pitfalls with it? Maybe he's just genuinely ignorant and doesn't understand why everyone looks down on him for it? Think about those things with the above info in mind."
cqugat2&ukpolitics&englishweather&"If by pedant you mean ""someone who understands the difference between the licence fee and tax"" then yes I am.

cqugatf&Physics&Statici&"Where are you hearing this? I recall the news that it ""wasn't quantum"" years ago, but everything I read about simply stated that it wasn't a full quantum computer; it most certainly houses qubits, and the methodology behind it is adiabatic wavefunction collapse. I don't completely understand how that can be used for computation, but I know Google is already using it to improve their search algorithms...using methods previously developed in adiabatic quantum computing theory. So it may not be a full ""quantum computer"" by some peoples' definitions, but they do advertise that these 512 qubits *are* addressable, they do charge *ten million dollars* for the thing, and it does perform algorithms based in quantum information theory. IMHO, that makes it pretty quantum, no? (Plus read the documentation on how the thing works; Josephson Junction coupling is still very much a quantum mechanical operation...)"

cqugaun&offmychest&shutupburrito&"You do have a valid point--I've always been a bit of a behind the scenes person. While I'm super bubbly and extraverted IRL, I'm not too big on bringing much attention to myself. I don't even have a Facebook because I just found it so weird over the years. 

Perhaps I kinda inadvertently set a standard without realizing it, and reading this made me reflect. I reached out to some people today after reading this last night and thinking things through. Some people are still jerks--but that's just who they are and I know to just stay away from them. Others did care. Again, my family and my boyfriend's (he's coming with) don't really, and that cuts real deep, but what are ya gonna do?

I do agree with the other commenter though as well. I think it's one thing to suggest something, as in ""Hey maybe we should do this small thing Saturday for my birthday"", but in my experience, I've known way too many people who, when they suggest such things, are very over the top and it just always came to me as tacky, especially (to me) if they haven't really achieved anything."

cqugawk&FeMRADebates&jolly_mcfats&"I don't think that every movie needs to pass the bechdel test (and to this point, some have proposed the mako mori test to address what some see as deficiencies in the bechdel test).  So long as we can agree that the Bechdel test isn't a test which demonstrates whether a movie should or should not be made, but which can be used to examine movies made in a year in aggregate- it seems like a useful tool to me.

Back when we were doing the advocacy exchange project, we had a subject on the portrayal of women in popular media, and the bechdel test [featured heavily in what I wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/1y3pvf/taep_mra_discussion_portrayal_of_women_in_popular/cfh4984).

I guess the TLDR is: my only criticisms of the bechdel test would be if it is proposed as an absolute metric for the worth of a movie, or presented as an infallible way to identify whether a movie depicted strong women, or if it was presented as the only way to determine if a movie treated gender fairly.

The reason Bruce was able to withstand the Gamma Ray burst which would have killed anyone else was because of the regenerative trait he was born with that was passed on by his father. 

I think you have real issues understanding non-standard narrative devices. No one was exposed to anything in that blast other than possible radioactive drift, unless they made it out of the exclusion zone. Or it wasn't even radioactive. Mushroom clouds can be caused by all kinds of explosions. 

He needed to cure his son because he never intended for his son to be a part of the experiment and he had no idea what it would do to Bruce. In the end the passed down trait saved Bruce from a Gamma Ray burst that would have surely killed him. I have no problem with them figuring out a way to make it marginally more believable why Bruce would survive that Gamma Ray burst as it would melt any person exposed to it. In fact even his friend shouldn't have survived. 

You are wrong many people like the Hulk especially film enthusiasts. I understand if you just like straight forward comic films, Hulk was just different. "

cqugazn&AskReddit&LordAnope&"I have very vivid dreams every night, here are the two most common.

- I walk down the stairs into a dark basement. There is always a door at the bottom. It slowly creeks open and a giant hissing crocodile emerges. I try to scramble up the stairs and keep tripping and falling the whole way up. I finally get to the top and collapse and my legs wont work. I try to scream for help but nothing comes out, all while this croc slowly gets closer and closer. Eventually it gets to me and eats me.

- This one the context of the dream is always different except for 1 detail it always takes place in the mountains. I could be riding a bike, in the city in the middle of a car chase, or in a park with some girl I wanna bang. Then out of nowhere a giant meteorite impacts the side of a mountain nearby and huge chunk of the mountain gets blown off and flies towards me. It is always so vivid and real. So this chunk is massive and I know there is nothing I can do but just watch it fly towards me. Right before it impacts I wake up.

I forgot about a sleep paralysis dream I get. Not as common as the other 2, I get it maybe 3 times a year. I will be lying in bed and then I wake up (at least I think I do) but I cant move a single muscle. The only thing that functions is my eyes. Then a black cat with glowing eyes will jump up onto the foot of the bed start hissing at and screeching at me while it slowly crawls up my body towards my face. I will try and kick and scream but nothing works. Its much like the Crocodile dream except I can see and sense everything going on around me. my girlfriend has even been watching TV beside me while it happens and looked at me and asked ""whats wrong with me?"" while I stare into space not blinking or moving. And I can see her and hear her but cant respond. eventually the cat gets to my stomach, crouches low lets out a hiss and pounces at my throat. As its mid leap it just turns to smoke and disappears. The second it disappears I can move and scream, and I do every time.... The weird part is everything stays the same its like the only thing that was dream was the cat that was put into the real world that I see in front of me. "

cqugb11&heroesofthestorm&zenerbufen&"In the defense of many abbathurs,

The stab has a fairly longish cooldown, and a long range. Usually it is not the distance that is the problem, but the angle, and when it is the distance it is usually by only a step or two.

When you get a shield, get a non-minion blocked angle and just take a step or two closer so the stab can fire then back off again and stay back for at least 4 seconds. It doesn't take to many stabs to get them low enough that you can 'assassinate' them with your abilities.

Spike has a shorter range than stab and a longer cool down (8 ish seconds). If you see an opening to close to half range and minions are blocking the stab dart in, let abba do a spike from behind the safety of minions then run away before the enemy can run around to you. Spike isn't minion blocked like stab is."

cqugb17&Psychonaut&7thDRXN&"My only UFO experience was while standing over a hill overlooking my hometown with a few of my closest friends from high school; we were all just standing there, facing the mountain and talking.

Suddenly, a HUGE ball of light with a white hot center and green rim shot across the sky, starting from the top-right corner of our vision and passed over the mountain in front of us within a second, *maybe* a second and a half. The weird thing was that it lit up the top part of the mountain it was passing over... like, a lot of it. It was real bright.

We all just sorta sat there for a second until someone piped up... uh, did anyone else see that? Agreed on color, shape, momentum. Our skeptic said it had to be a missile test from the nearby military spot but that thing was flying relatively low to the ground which is super dangerous, the base is 30 miles away, and that thing was moving CRAZY QUICK. Like, at least 5x the speed of an airplane at the same relative distance.

I also had an ex -- born, raised and practicing Catholic, never really ventured into any philosophy or other religions -- who would fall into trance and speak in really esoteric terminology. It was incredibly weird but also super fascinating. She would completely forget what she had said, ""wake up"" and I would be sitting there with my jaw on the floor."

cqugb2h&pcmasterrace&3ugenics&"The comment I refer to is the one I anonimised as green.  I know this will probably generate some flak, but I feel it's worth it for it's importance.  

For some context, the video was about Verdun, a PC exclusive WW1 shooter.  It's especially crucial in times like these when a console gamer admits a PC would be good to have, to be nice and helpful to them, providing cost effective builds, and overall giving a good impression, instead he got the same old troll comment putting him down for owning a different system, even calling him a peasant even though, as far as I can tell, he's no where near that.  Imagine how quickly we could have had him take an interest in PC gaming!

Maybe the first comment made by 'green' was a bit of tounge and cheek joking, but his second comment was really un-nessecary.
We need to make sure we send the right message to others about who we are (e.g.  lessen the use of peasantry unless absolutely deserved), even apologising for someone's bad behaviour is good enough to ammend hard feelings.  

Overall, please, don't be *that* guy.  "

cqugb2u&survivor&shutupredneckman&"Haha, I'm trying my best to give you the benefit of the doubt but you're not making it easy.

It's not ""I thought Shirin's edit"". It's that the editors have repeatedly promised us of an uprising by the good people, and that the editors have deliberately made the good guys super-good, and the bad guys evil caricatures. There was plenty of film that could have made the core 6 likable or human, but they chose very actively to make them awful so that when Mike wins it will be more triumphant. The issue with that is that all of the episodes leading up to Mike's victory suck, because of the false hope manufactured by the storytelling. Compare to an actual good season like PI, where the Rupert boot wasn't handled as ""Don't worry, Rupert will pull through"", but as this incredible tragic fall of a hero.

I had a website long before I had a YouTube channel, so for me it was a no-brainer to create a Google account for my site.  So when I started doing YouTube reviews, I just used that Google account.  Of course, if you started making YT videos and uploading them using your personal YT account, then it's kind of too late...

cqugb5r&leagueoflegends&retsudrats&"This was pretty much my only complaint about the chromas. Back in the day, a recolor felt like it had a lot more work put into it than just simply opening up the uncolored texture in photoshop and pressing the ""bucket fill"" option.

I think they are a cool idea, but Id prefer they be sold separately rather than together. Even if all 3 would cost more than the current 590 or what ever it is, Id still prefer them being liek 300 each.

Its like people on video game auctions. You have a stack of 50(say 2 gold each for a total of 100g) of an item, versus a stack of 200(1g each for a total of 200g) of an item. The latter is cheaper per unit, but you only need 50...So while I am paying a little more for less, I am overall paying less gold for what I need.

Same applies here. Hell, release them separately for 300 each, and release them also as a bundle where its buy 2 get 1 free kind thing. This makes the pack price 600, while individually costing 900 total."

So pre-Kakuja she is probably stronger then normal, but Kakuja wise she would almost be on a level field.

Also as others have said, there is the issue of RC count. Kakuja obviously don't really have the issue of maintaining the Kakuja as they have tons of RC from cannibalizing and such, but Hinami who doesn't have so much RC stores could probably only hold it out for a short amount of time."

It isn't like shredder where you have a general sense you will get a ~2/2.  You get awful, good in 1 circumstance, in another situation this would be good, meh, and Holy cow this wins me the game.  You do not get the filter like thoughtsteal, and more than likely, the spell itself will not win you the game.  

Now Ysera's card is always good (not always the best), but always good.  If you are comparing the two,   80% of the time I prefer ysera.  Chrommagus is tricky.  I think certain decks will want to play Chrommagus, but in general, the other two are better, because you get immediate effect.  "

I'm considering giving aqua aerobics a try, and possibly Zumba. Zumba appeals to me, but there's only one class a week at the gym I can make it to. Eventually I'll give it a try. Perhaps Yoga, too.

cqugbdi&Insurance&izznt&"Afraid the other answer is not correct. Insurance in almost all US states follows your vehicle. Once you allow someone to drive your vehicle, you are assuming liability if they are in an accident. (Which is why, for example, insurance companies can deny damages caused when a car is stolen.) 

If your vehicle was in an accident and your insurance company had to pay out either to you or the other vehicle/property that was damaged - regardless of who was driving - that is a claim on your policy. If the driver of your car wasn't at fault, hopefully there will be no surcharge. If he/she was at fault, you will lose any ""No Claim"" discounts you have and may also see a surcharge if the claim exceeds whatever threshold your company has set. "

cqugbgu&AskReddit&dumbguy82&"Your observations are correct.  I do look for those subtle reinforcements because I don't want to see them.  I want to eliminate them off my list of things which are or are not possible.

I started having a thought about a year ago.   I came to the stunning realization that I'm the only thing in existence that can feel any way about me.   That didn't change that fact that outside influences had an effect on my feelings, but to really realize that was pretty important I think.  Even when others judge you, it's your feelings that make you feel what you feel. 

Also, that feeling you described about feeling ""bad"", and ""Not worthy"", those are bang on.   Because I've realized that I feel very uncomfortable around innocence.   Around babies/children, dogs, really kind people, family....etc.  I am naturally attracted to dark things, those things interest me more than positive light things, and that's supposed to be bad and negative.    My idea of heaven is not white and bright things and perfectly clean clothing, it's carnivals and fun houses, and fast cars and tunnels that lead to alternate dimensions and entertainment (basically Earth minus the shit I don't like)....etc.   I've always wondered if that is spiritual, or psychological, or if they are one and the same.  I've heard it's kind of common to be afraid of children, but I think it's weird.   I guess i'm into some stuff that most would consider kind of shameful, and I know that if they knew they'd feel differently about me.  Only my closest friend knows about one of them, and I am very fortunate that he is alright knowing it.  The way I feel, is beyond my control though...But one can feel like a dud, when comparing themselves to the status quo or general ideas about what constitutes a good soul, or a corrupt damaged one.  it's natural I guess.

So I think it's bad for a different reason in that these teachers will begin disliking teaching more and more and will hurt students views to learning before they quit. You have to love kids and teaching otherwise you're doing a disservice to the students.

cqugbin&KotakuInAction&carefuldave&"It's not too confusing if you are cynical enough to believe people will be duplicitous and manipulative if given the chance.

The writer ""Zak"" bugged Eron to do an interview for an extended period. Eron is smart but incredibly naive - I assume this Zak guy assured him he'd write a fair article. Instead, he likely intended to trash him all along, while assuring LW he'd make her look good.

It was interesting that the Zak guy seemed to create a new twitter account to ask Eron for the interview. I googled it the other day and it seemed there was only one tweet (this is a separate account from his real twitter account).

Another interesting point in Eron's tumblr response was that he logged into his Facebook account on Zak's laptop to show him the chat logs with LW. So there's no excuse for Zak having overlooked the abuse and deceit Eron was subjected to.

This all tells me Zak is an SJW, an activist writer who intended all along to smear Eron. It's beyond my comprehension why Eron would agree to an interview after the three or four hit pieces SJW journalists did on him last Fall."

The only thing which locked you into specific specilisations rather than choosing what you want was the reveal that you only choose three trait lines to specialise in. It ended up having nothing to do with elite specialisations.

Honestly, when you look at the proposed trait lines, they are seem similar to elite specialisations anyway - longbows will build Marksmanship, Traps and Shortbows will build Skirmishing, Spirits will take Nature Magic etc. Locking down the staff to the Druid trait line seems like less of a limitation when you consider than most players running an existing weapon are heavily encouraged to trait that weapon anyway."

cqugbl2&actuallesbians&elmay&"I came out to my parents when I was 20 and for the next 10 years or so, we had off and on contact. I didn't go searching for a parental figure, but looking back, I realize that I related to many of my managers as parental figures. [I'm an engineer working in product development organizations.] Frankly, many of those managers helped me grow up. Sometimes I was sort of ""adopted"" a bit by my partner's parents as well.

Now I am in my 50's and a manager. I wouldn't say I play a ""parental"" role in some people's lives, but I am on the mentor side more often than on the ""being mentored"" side.

One thing I have noticed throughout my career is that there are a lot of people, straight and gay, who seem to be seeking parental approval (as I did) in vain. Unfortunately, having a messed up relationship with your parents is not exclusive to being gay/lesbian, but it sure seems more common amongst us."

The thing is that Iran is merely a signatory, and the United States hasn't signed that UN Convention at all-- so both sides use their status to suggest they can act abnormally.  Iran claims they can dick around if they want, and the US has warned everyone that they *will* dick around if others do."

Hello! Your post has been automatically removed because I believe it is a tweak release post that uses a Cydia screenshot. If it isn't, please disregard the rest of this message and contact the moderators to get your post approved.

Cydia screenshots aren't very informative when it comes to release posts because it usually tells people nothing other than the name of the tweak and repo it is hosted on. It doesn't give us any screenshots, description about the tweak, or its price and thus doesn't help people decide if it is a tweak they would find useful. You're welcome to repost this, but please follow these two steps first:

1. Check to see if somebody else hasn't already posted it. If they have, then there's no need for you to post it.
2. Check out our [wiki page on making good posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/greatposts)
3. Post a link to the Cydia depiction, a [link to the package](http://redd.it/19ppxl), a tweet made by the developer, or an article or YouTube video about the tweak

Thanks for understanding!

cqugbmv&AskReddit&IntentionalMisnomer&I live in one of the bike theft capitals in America. So bad that it's one of two cities that Kryptonite doesn't guarantee their locks. What you do here is register your bike with the police department so if it's stolen and found, then they know who it belongs to and that it's yours. Sure it makes it significantly harder if they file off the serial number but it's better than nothing. Maybe if you really care enough about your bike you can microchip it like you can your pet.

today turned from a splurge into a full blown binge day. I honestly cannot express how ashamed I feel right now to write this. I stole food from the common fridge. I feel terrible, physically and mentally. Actually I think I'm having a panic attack now. I've suddenly plunged into darkness, why the hell did I do this to myself?? I've gone over 4000 calories for sure and the sugar content must be through the roof. I'm bloated and what's worse: that hopeless depressive feeling has overwhelmed me. It's 1 am in the morning and I should be asleep.

Geezus fucking Christ what's happening, why??? This is like the end of March when I binged at home, except I did it the last day at halls of residence.

cqugbos&AskReddit&TatTater&"I am sorry to be the baron of bad news, but you seem buttered, so allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies, and are more than just ice king on the cake. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite.
So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality.
I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go.
Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the fax, instead of making a half-harded effort.
You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it's a peach of cake."

cqugbqb&AskReddit&umday&"Dreams where I cheat. I forget in the dream that I have a girlfriend, then emotionally cheat and start to physically cheat on them. Partway though I go ""oh shit what the fuck am I doing what is wrong with me"". Then, I proceed to feel awful and freak out for a few dream days. In some dreams, I tell my SO that I cheated, she is devastated, I'm feeling like I deserve to die. Then, I wake up and continue to feel awful and guilty about the dream and how convinced I was of what's happening.

I don't know why these happen. I never have cheated on anyone, and I don't plan to. I think it stems from a distrust of myself, distrust of self control, and fear of how I would react to myself if I were to cheat on someone.

I rarely dream, but when I do, it is incredibly convincing. Since I dream so little, this dream makes up a solid 5-10% of my dreams and I always wake up believing it happened, and not realizing it was a dream for a few minutes."

They also get a Hex that can cause a -4 penalty to AC and CMD with only a partial Will save - even if they succeed, they still take the penalty for one round.

For curiosity's sake though, and keeping in mind that they have the verizon modem/router and a 16 port gigabit switch...

You're saying to setup the verizon as modem only, plug it into a 3 port business class router that supports vlan, use a port on that router to go out to the 16 port switch for the business wired network.

Then, inside the router, configure a vlan just for wireless. Just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly. Thanks!"

cqugbus&EliteDangerous&LazilytotheLeft&"That's an interesting Theory. Since I'm an engineer and not a theoretical particle physicist, I enjoy working with tangible objects instead of weird little matter bugs. So that kind of theoretical drive is too beyond my understanding to offer a comment to the affirmative or negative. However, it sounds plausible. If a particle was spun (enough to provide a measurable, useful change in space-time) and shot by a compact particle accelerator (or it could drift into it, who am I to judge a lazy particle?) into an energy uptake system on the other side, I can see that working. This field change would need to be modulated to provide more efficient  ""forward"" travel through space-time. Modulated or given an ""anti-spin"" (as I see it it my head) to cause a (to me) a necessary opposite shift in space time at the other end. Where a higher point mass might cause a contraction of space time on one end, and a higher ""anti""mass would cause an expansion. My use of anti doesn't mean I'm necessarily suggesting spinning an anti particle, because I don't know much about antimatter and the like and their properties. I just mean ""do the opposite on the other end"".

It's might be possible that doing the same thing to something else might produce expansion. It's also possible that a different method is the only way of doing that and the uptake system could power that too. Who knows. 

But yeah I really like your input. I might contact you about your opinions while I do these articles. I'd also like to get drunk and have a conversation about this stuff with you. I believe that would be a good time. My brain hurts less when I think about things like this from a very specific view point for too long. It's not that it's necessarily hard, just that I start picturing (or trying to) 4th dimensional effects when my brain is so firmly rooted in flatland.

cqugbxr&exjw&NuclearLupine&"I personally think that she is going to be just fine where she is right now.  At her age I was just fine, and I see her being treated well, so I'm pretty sure she's going to be just fine. Not to mention the few times my parents have been away she was immediately filled with separation anxiety, so it would be best if I could leave her where she is now.  Parents treat her fairly, they don't yell, they may be pretty strict at times but I don't think that necessitates removing her.

I understand what you are saying, and I thank you for your kind words and wise thoughts.  I think my little sister will be just fine if she stays with my parents. In time, she will start to clash with them in her teen years and I will be there for her.

What I need to focus on right now is me. Like it says in the OP, should I be trying to move out by the end of the school year or a month before? It looks like moving out a month before would be optimal because the social worker is talking with me *now* and getting out a month ahead of the summer vacation rush would cut down on competition for places to rent and possibly a part-time job to supplement the Youth Agreement.

First, the crops which get cut will be the least important ones.  Almonds are getting a lot of flak, but they're high price products and will continue being produced.  Rice and alfalfa (which can be grown in a ton of places, and are very water intensive) are the low hanging fruit for what farmers may stop producing.

Second, the commodity price of vegetables is a pretty small chunk of overall food costs.  Much more of the food budget of Americans goes into meat, packaging, transportation, and marketing than does commodity vegetables.

Third, there are substitution effects.  California produces a lot of vegetables, but lots of vegetables get grown in other places too.  For instance, green beans are primarily produced in slightly colder climates.  It's quite possible that people will eat fewer of the vegetables California specializes in, and more of some other vegetables, when the price changes."

Also on the percentage thing...if you have a recipe that is good at 18% and decide to scale it back to 14% respectively, your going to just end up with a recipe that has less overall flavor and may not be as enjoyable. I wouldn't go that route. Just make the juice the way it is supposed to be in your original recipe without scaling. There is a massive profit margin selling juice anyway, especially if you are just selling to friends etc because you basically have no overhead.

cqugc1j&australia&PsychoPhilosopher&"Except that this assumes our goals are opposite and our voices equal.

The tension you describe requires us to be in constant balance of forces.  If one group or voice becomes the stronger, and using that strength reinforces itself, then it becomes impossible for the tension to be maintained.

That view has a certain appeal, the ideal of symmetry is elegant and if achieved, powerful.

But it is also fragile.

At present it is best to imagine that the rope in the middle, that which we pull back and forth in our tug of war, has begun to fray.

As that takes place we separate, and worse yet, we stagnate.

Should that rope that binds us together snap entirely, we end up at war within our own nation, the very end that democracy seeks to avoid.  Whether through violent civil revolt, or the militarization of domestic police forces, the peace we sought to maintain is broken.

That's why it's impossible to get anything done.  That centre place of compromise grows thin and weak, it won't support the kind of work that needs to be done.

It also makes us vulnerable to outside changes.

The tension between workers and employers for example is a careful balance.  Introducing the concept of climate change, and the necessity of action on that front adds another rope to the pull on neither of those sides.  Workers fear for their livelihoods, and employers fear for their profits, so both pull against the greater good, attempting to strain enough to move the mountain that is reality.

In essence, this only works for the most limited of scenarios.  Perhaps it might work to encourage the poorest to pull against the richest.  But there is no centre point or common ground where reality is concerned.  It is what it is, and no amount of politics or voting or compromise will change that.

So at times reality will loom on that fringe, and we must all decide to abandon our previous arguments and tensions and move to safe ground.  If not, the floods will raise the water over our heads, and our tug of war will see only floating corpses still clinging to a now slack rope.

We have to be willing and able to vote according to our good conscience, our true wisdom and our intellects, not only according to our momentary benefit. "

cqugc1z&bloodborne&Darksoulja&I doubt it would have been that extreme. Souls games already had different state-of-beings that affected not only your stats, but your movements as well (i.e. soul form, hollowing and low equipment load, heavy equipment load) aside from an aesthetically altered state-of-being, which given this studios ability to design brilliant- looking monsters, a roleplaying element was all it needed to be, perhaps with a slower moveset and adjustments to stats that would hinder/enhance certain approaches to combat. There are hundreds of different ways to make it work, and I am not buying the fact they couldn't.

cqugc2g&mac&snnh&"It does not perform like a quad core. Hyperthreading greatly reduces time spent switching between threads. It basically eliminates any performance penalty from running 2 processing threads on 1 available core because of this, but those two threads still only get 1/2 of the CPU's attention each.

4 physical cores will double your performance (100% improvement) if all of them are busy. Hyperthreading increases performance from 0% to 30% depending on what you are doing.

That's not bad at all, and when you have only 2 cores you are quite likely to multitask and take advantage of Hyperthreading compared to the same tasks on a hyperthreaded 4 core CPU.

So this is one of the many factors that improve this CPU's performance compared to an older processor (or an AMD processor) but it unfortunately is not the same as having 4 cores-- ever "

If they just slam out more smaller creatures, you can just keep building the board while trading, hoping to get some of your resilient guys online.  

You really can't really afford to Abzan Charm for cards on an empty board, that just leaves you dead in 2 turns.  Raksha Deathdealer doesn't actually do anything on this board.  Fleecemane can trade, but has slightly more late game value than Anafenza unless you get a board established."

cqugc68&Planetside&Terafir&"DPS means nothing in Planetside 2 unless you could guarantee that every single shot hits the target. Thus, we use TTK, and that doesn't factor in 99% of the time when flying either.

The reason Tomcats are hated is the fact that 'they take no skill to use', which, while being rather generic, is also correct. Keeping a lock while under fire causes you to die quicker, as you just have to keep it in the general area, rather than matching the manoeuvres performed by the enemy, which has the side effect of dodging enemy fire.

If you want to use a secondary other than afterburner tanks, go with the Coyotes. While they do little damage, they damage the enemy while your primary is reloading, enabling you to keep up the damage as much as possible. People will respect you far more, and will be willing to teach you and fly with you if you use Coyotes rather than Tomcats.

As for dying a lot, I really hate saying this, but get used to it. It's only been recently I've been able to begin taking on enemy aircraft in a 1v1 and win, but against any pilot who has been flying longer than me, they will easily kill me (hence why I run stealth for ambushes and getaways). It's just the way it is. 'Softening' the blow of death through Tomcats really doesn't help much, because once you get good with the nosegun/Coyotes, it's scary what you can do. But with the Tomcats your flight style never changes, you never learn anything because you're always flying the exact same way: to keep the lock. 

If you want to become better whatsoever, ditch the Tomcats. It's nothing but a crutch."

C'est ce que j'explique depuis quelques temps déjà. Pour moi entre Android et Apple, il ni y'en a pas un qui soit mieux que l'autre. Seulement l'un plus adapté aux besoins d'une personne que l'autre. 

iOS est tellement plus facile d'accès en terme de design, d'uniformité dans ses applications etc qu'Android. Mais en même temps c'est au prix d'une certaine limitation des liberté de son utilisation (et j'intègre là dedans les limitations pour pouvoir publier certaines applications). 

Mais oui par contre Android est plus ouvert, on trouve une plus grande variété de fonctionnalité via les applications disponibles mais parfois au prix de quelques risques de sécurité pour l'utilisateur. 

J'ai beau être utilisateur Android, si quelqu'un qui n'est pas technophile me demande un conseil sur l'os, si le prix est pas le point essentiel je lui conseillerais un iPhone sans hésité. Android correspond plus à mes attentes/besoins perso qu'iOS, mais c'est pas pour autant que c'est le cas de tout le monde."

cqugc6s&pics&Bobshayd&aha, I meant that if you say that someone calling race a factor sounds like they're calling it a direct factor instead of a correlative thing that has roots in hundreds of years of history, that you're legitimizing that sort of belief. I don't like shying away from explicitly and repeatedly saying that there ARE differences between races, but that they are caused by inequality rather than causing them, and that they aren't innate but they are forced upon them by systematic influences, and that it is just so horrible to judge people that way, and I shouldn't say that you were, but rather that it felt like you were allowing too much power to people who try to skew such statements in unreasonable ways.

cqugc8b&videos&Benemy&The other day I was talking to a younger black man and he claimed that it's impossible for black people to be racist. His reasoning was that racism means one race feeling superior to another race, and because black people have it so bad they can't possibly see themselves as superior to another race. They could be prejudiced, just not racist. A couple other black people agreed with him. 
cqugc8c&AskVet&Neryian&"There is a huge difference between giving a shot to a person and to an animal.  First, humans have very small Subcutaneous space, as such the only injects that are given that way are generally insulin.  Give a person an injection between the skin and muscle with your average 25  or 22 gauge needle and you are asking to be punched in the face.  Human vaccines are given into a muscle as we tend to have large muscle bellies than a cat.

Prep for subcutaneous shots are also very different.  Try to tent my skin and I will punch you.  Don't tent a cats skin and you will either hit a muscle, a blood vessel or a nerve. Two of which can result in you getting bit if the person restraining isn't ready for it.  

So no, injections sound the same, but can be different depending on the species.  RN's are excellent at poking people, but without instructions shouldn't be poking any other species.

He ate almost all the food in the house, and drank an entire gallon of milk. And come on... he knew we were broke, and didn't offer to replace any it. I'm not one to begrudge a guest hospitality, but the amount of food he ate at our house was a couple weeks worth of grocery budget! It hurt!"

cqugc8u&Luthier&catdumpling&"I *love* Sapele, especially with a lot of ribboning in it. Outside of guitars, it's also become popular with kitchen cabinets and countertop manufacturers.

The problem with ""alternate"" woods like this, though, is that as companies jump on them as cheaper/more readily available, they're going to end up over-harvesting them just like they did with the ""old"" stuff. Luckily there are better environmental protections in place, but many countries where exotic woods grow also unfortunately suffer from lots of government corruption; it's *very* easy for unscrupulous wood vendors to grease the palms of the politicians and policy makers in a lot of those countries, which has historically been an issue with woods like ebony. Not only do *we* have to want sustainably harvested lumber, but we have to convince those other countries that it's in their best interest to responsibly harvest their own lumber. Because many of those countries have a high rate of poverty, they're more inclined to take bribes and look the other way, in many cases simply because they're just trying to survive.

It's a much more complicated issue than ""just don't cut too much down"". It makes navigating the waters of exotic lumber pretty tricky, especially if one wants to avoid questionably-harvested wood yet still use exotic timbers."

Not yet, apparently, if Florida's recovery is any indication.

But as has been pointed out, FEMA's new guidelines are BRUTAL in some areas, and can even restrict how much work is done on a property (50% of the appraised value) if the property is deemed in a flood zone. That aside, I read one news story of a commercial owner that saw a jump of insurance rates from $3500 a year to $50,000 (I think it was the Gulf coast).

cqugcbi&depression&Rootner&"I was a generally sad child. But I don't feel like my problems stemmed from that. Years ago I decided that I wanted to join the army. It sounded like a good idea. Wrong. I'm not sure what it was that first triggered my major depression episodes, but it happened. I started falling apart. I had a rough experience. The army shuns the weak, both mental and physical. I'm strong but was still developing mentally at 18, still learning the world and who I was. Uncontrollable actions, such as fits of depression and anger made my life hell. The others picked up on it. I felt like they would rather leave me behind then help my up. I was right. I have one very vivid memory that I remember every day. I was laying in my bed (separated from the other beds in the middle of the room), with my two ""guards"" standing watch. Yeah, I had to have at least two people within arms reach of me at all times, even while sleeping. It got that bad. One of them decided he didn't have time for this. All I did was look at him and sigh. He took my pillow from under my head and tried to suffocate me. And I just laid there. Not moving. I didn't care. It didn't last long as the other people in the room (47 people) stepped in. After the event the drill sergeant walked in, unaware of the events that had transpired moments before. He walked up to me as I was laying in bed again. He bent over me and asked my how I was. I said that I was fine and he left. It has taken me a very long time to understand how I felt about this. Turns out I was angry at myself for failing something that I set out to do. I felt like garbage for so long. It took me 5 years to admit to myself that my self directed anger and loathing ment nothing. The past is the past. There is nothing that can be done about it. But my future, my happiness needs not be influenced by past failures. I was angry at myself, and I finally learned why. And I finally forgave myself."

[This is what happens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Leelah_Alcorn) when you fuck around with that. Gender dysphoria is caused by a permanent structure in the brain present from pre-birth, by the way. You can't really make it go away or change it to fit with any kind of technology we're even remotely close to possessing.

cqugcc7&AskReddit&dlkog&"I'm not the previous commenter, but I'll give it a shot.  Presumably, these ancient Jewish judicial codes (if they had any validity) were ordered by God.  I would think any rule against gay sex then would be just as applicable now.  Honestly, for most thinking people, there needs to be an actual reason for a change in the laws (especially those mandated by God), but I can't see why any rule against gay sex then would be less applicable now.  Seriously, why would god say that homosexuals should be executed?  Why was that okay back then, but not now?

As for ""Hate the sin. Love the sinner"", it's like saying ""I still love you, but I hate a thing that you do that is (likely) closely tied with a major part of your identity.""  There's no denying that many people have used the Bible to justify hatred against gays.  And look at 1 Timothy 1:10.  It literally compares homosexuals to murderers and slavers.  Even if hatred of gays wasn't the intent, these statements still encourage it."

What would matter to Thoorin is if his short term power ranking boost continued into the next split, and helped his team improve their standings. Until then it's all about ""what if's"" or special matches that don't even account for at least 1/2 of that player's total game contribution. "

cqugcfk&homeautomation&gnomeza&"Having spent another couple of days with OpenHAB I'm satisfied that it was the right way to go.

We want to have Android and iOS as the standard platforms for accessing and controlling house stuff. Kodi apps (Kore, Yatse, etc) for the media, OpenHAB for automation. Since every project (and its users) is different in significant ways, flexibility in the UI design turns out to be quite important.

With Domoticz and I was initially excited by the potential of the Lua scripting but OpenHAB has so many appealing bindings (plugins) available - bluetooth, networkhealth, TV interfaces, XBMC/Kodi...

Integrating with network monitoring apps like Cacti is important to me. OpenHAB will write its persistence data to RRDs if you want and I expect those will be pretty easy to make visible to Cacti. I have no idea how I'd get the graph data out of Domoticz short of scraping the database or manually exporting the graphs (in CSV?).

I'm still coming to terms with OpenHAB's use of Java and Xtend. The last time I did any serious work in Java was in 2002. It's matured quite a bit since (lambda syntax, whee!), so the learning curve for serious scripting is still steep.

There are a couple of tricks I've learned so far for OpenHAB UI configuration:

* Don't use Groups in the Sitemap (except as summary values). It's really tempting but just don't. Explicit is better.

* Don't bother with the Setpoint elements. They're currently very slow and user-unfriendly. Using a Selection with a mapping argument listing every possible value is actually so much more user-friendly.

cqugcgw&nba&Anachronym&"As a social media person, ""pushing the envelope"" is fine, but crossing the envelope is not. If, **as an official extension/liaison of a brand**, you post something that violates the standard of social decorum for a business, and that makes the business look bad, you will not have a job at the end of the day.

You can post whatever you want on your own time and on your own twitter feed. Nobody is stopping you from doing this. Be offensive if you want. But as brand representative or voice, (if you expect to remain employed) you follow the rules and project a positive image at all times. "

Since inflation is not necessarily a bad thing, not raising the minimum wage in an attempt to not increase inflation will just cause harm, and no good could come of it."

Me: Umm isn't it really old? What about Socrates?

Him: Well except for him, its all 20th century really. I also love it for its alignment with science, science and philosophy go together so well.

cqugcjc&hockey&Wheezin_Ed&He hasn't had a solid year since the Vezina push in 12-13 where he had a. 924 Sv%. I'd imagine the Sharks will look to draft a goalie soon, probably higher up, considering they don't have any blue chip goalie prospects, and are pretty thin there. Maybe they go after Ilya Samsonov. There's no real chance Dubnyk leaves Minnesota for San Jose, so the only free agent they could go after that would make sense would be Niece himself, but I'd imagine there might be some difficulty since they don't seem confident enough in Nemo to give him a long term deal and a bridge deal may not be enough to keep him. Perhaps they sign and trade, or look for another option via trade. Bernier or Reimer could be available. There's a chance either Hammond or Anderson leave Ottawa, depending on how the situation develops with them and Lehner. Buffalo trades goalies all the time; maybe Lindback makes a comeback and they flip him for the rebuild. That's a bit of a long shot, but he showed promise at the end of the season with them. Maybe Vancouver moves Markstrom if he continues his rebound. Maybe with Gillies joining the Flames they look to move Ramo. There's even a chance they could go after prospects like Kristers Gudlevskis, Zachary Fucale or Malcolm Subban. I'm just saying they have options, but they will likely have to give up something to get a goalie here if theyre not drafting one.

People say, ""Krokodil is a flesh eating bacteria that will put holes in you!"" then they find out that nah, it ain't nearly that bad so everything else they say about it is probably bullshit. Then they end up with holes in their body, albeit not nearly at the scale as those pictures, because it's still a nasty drug. "
cqugclc&CCW&Thisismygunaccount&An example of a felony i like to use is supplying alcohol to minors. If you have ever in your adult life handed a beer to someone under 21, let your kid take a sip of your beer, let your little brother come to your house party, etc... you've committed a felony (in my state). It isn't just drugs and violence that can make you a felon.

Planned Parenthood is an extreme organization led by someone who is in favor of elective late term abortion, and its founder Margaret Sanger was even more extreme. 

Abortion's simply not going away as an issue. Not in either of our lifetimes. Gay marriage can mostly go away, if both sides can respect each other's right to disagree. Even that will never fully go away as an issue.  "

Fraps require every step manually and cannot be prepped the same way; the most we can do w/2 blenders is try to batch blend (against the rules) or line up cups with the frap roast and/or milk in it and wait an age for a clean pitcher to open up.

cqugcms&worldnews&Visceral94&"You are taking about two different issues here.

1) there should have been damage to reputation of banks. In my opinion there was to an extent, although most of it was mitigated as being ""banks were being greedy"". This is a different situation, as the investment bank is making public its position on a huge investment issue. If they, with all of their educated employees , get it wrong, then they aren't worth much as an investment Bank are they? A loud public declaration like this is betting that they will be right, and will be able to claim kudos in the investment world for predicting the trend.  

2) of course people are still investing in stocks you mutton chop. 2008 didn't change a thing about stocks being one of the best returning asset classes. "

There are lots of exposed rocks and rapids here, but none more technical than class II+. Very low consequences. Once the Brushkana hits Monahan Creek the pace drops very quickly, although it picks up a bit once Monahan Creek joins the Nenana. 

Approximately 1.5 miles after joining the Nenana there is a 4-wheel trail on river left that leads back to the Denali Highway (1.75 miles). Or you can continue along the Nenana to where it rejoins the highway (~7-8 river miles)."

cqugcq9&Celica&FoxCruiser&"Yeah... unfortunately ST205s aren't available here yet. However, since the rule is 25 years from manufacture date it's not going to be TOO long of a wait. The first ones go back to late '93 IIRC, so that translates into being legal in late 2018.

That being said there ARE a handful(I've heard 15 at this point) that made it here under dubious legality. They do sometimes come up for sale. However, you do run the risk of the feds taking notice and taking the car if you're unlucky. Personally I'm not willing to run that risk, but some are. Expect them to be quite expensive if/when they are sold.

Other things to note are that parts specific to the ST205, specifically brakes and suspension, are going to be almost completely ridiculously difficult to obtain. Engine parts shouldn't be -too- hard to find if needed, but you may have to order from overseas at some points, or at least a specialist shop that stocks parts for people who have swapped to 3rd and 4th-gen 3SGTEs.

My solution? I'm picking up a very clean '165 next week that will eventually have the entire '205 drivetrain swapped over. There's something about the fourth-gen bodystyle that just does it for me."

cqugcw5&WarSnipersClash&Baron_VI&"Ive been a part of about 40 farm-wars now, and only twice did my clan not get what they wanted. One was a japanese clan who we had no way of communicating with, and the other was a clan from Spain who agreed to the deal, but switched back at the last minute.

Still 38/40 is a 95% success rate. I've never understood Jr's issues with getting compliance, as I've never had an issue with it. Even in Jr2, I am the one who created the clan, so I was there for the first war, and our enemy was more than happy to comply. But seems it's has really gone downhill since I left. 

Of course, I cannot speak for all the clans, just for my own personal experience from being in 2.0, 2.5, the one war in Jr2, leading farm wars in my old clan ""Templar Knights"", and succesfully helping 2.4 and 2.6 get compliance from Korean clans."

If I accept an invite, and find out the heist is full, I am typically forced to find a new lobby and spend the next 30-60 seconds staring into the abyss. Why? Why can't I just jump back into the lobby I was originally in?

The only solution to playing this game with *any* form of expediency is to only play in invite-only sessions. If you want to do heists with your friends, just invite them to the session and when each mission is finished you just jump back together almost instantly. But to be quite honest, this is how the online should be from the start, not just for solo/invite only sessions."

Labour will get by until a point but every vote will be on a knife edge. They'll lose a lot and only a small number are confidence and even then it would take a back bench rebellion to sink them. Maybe they'll start doing positive popular things but I won't be holding my breath.

Last night there were 3 people at freeweights, and 3 people on shoulder day. 

One guy asked me to share my 7kg DBs which was ok, because he was actually using them first, but also using an incline bench at the smith machine. In the end I used 8kgs because impatient.

Then later when I was using the other incline bench, halfway through my set this other guy non-verbally asked to use the bench, to which I indicated that I was still using it. He then ask ""can share?"". The other guy still had his stuff at the other incline bench. I said ""try lor"", but I kinda knew that I'd be rather inconvenienced by it because I don't take long breaks between sets.

Halfway through 2nd guy's first set, the first guy removed his stuff from other incline bench. So I went and got the other incline bench and used it.

Qn: What could I have done to be more alpha in this situation? I should have asked 2nd guy to go and get the other incline bench himself, methinks. And then pee on the bench."

After you shave, rinse your face with cold water and rub the alum over your face(it'll sting if you got irritation, I'm sorry, but that's the nature of the beast) and then rinse it off and put on some face lotion or...if no face lotion....a couple drops of extra virgin olive oil(tons of vitamin A and E, sucks in the moisture, great stuff)."

i get where youre coming from, but realistically speaking, you have to prefilter problems like that. e.g. a scientist cant let criticism from every 4th grader influence how s/he does his or her job. sure there might be a gem hidden in the ginormous pile of shit, but its not worth it diving into the lake, and getting excrement all over you, especially since theres no guarantuee youll find it.

so you have to prefilter by expertise, cause more expertise means you spew less shit."

cqugd0c&Anarcho_Capitalism&berlinbrown&"I am glad that this group notices this.

When I see this article, I sigh because it sucks this guy or group may owe this much in taxes.  I feel sick.  It is organized theft from the government and no one is really pissed about it.  And it actually kind of goes to the absurdity of our progressive personal income tax system.  Pseudo percentage based tax system.


But there are a couple of big issues with taxes.

   *  First, everyone and even some dumb rich people advocate for ... higher taxes on the rich.    Why is this bad?  See my second point.
    * Second, where do taxes go?  They go to the biggest pyramid scheming, mega-corporation, trillion dollar budget, war machine that is our US government.     The US federal government and its reckless spending has reached astronomical heights with zero accountability.    It is kind of shocking and people want to tax more  and give the government more money.

Really, people just want to tax the rich.  That is the goal.  It doesn't matter where the money is going.  They want the rich to have less.  Which is a pretty dumb line of thinking.  Just because you tax the rich doesn't mean you automatically gain.  If you tax Soros 7 billion, doesn't mean you get 50k in your pocket.  It is really a dumb line of thinking and completely irrational.  I hate when people on the ""left"" advocate for higher taxes and don't really say why.  Some might get into the debt and social security costs and all of that, but my response to that is, well what about government spending?  Why don't we NOT spend 600 billion on defense?

All that to say, I don't get mad that people evade taxes.  We should all get pissed that the government machine will take parts of your wealth.  And we don't know what Soros and these rich guys will do with the money.  They were pretty successful, they will probably invest it in another successful firm or project.

Lack of motivation, coupled with an intense hatred for themselves for being overweight, coupled with easy routes to exercise (you don't need a gym, go walk/run/do push-ups/ and just be active for a start), and I don't see why you can't do it.

I've actually gotten into University of Toronto's second year then dropped out because I hated the experience so much, was by far the worst experience of my life. Anyhow, think I should put that on my resume somehow when I apply to JAC? Getting into U of T is a pretty decent achievement.

Both jobs appeal to me in different ways, I enjoy  helpdesk because I can talk to others most of the day. Electrician's/plumbing just appeals to me since it's hands on and I can ""complete"" something very real.

cqugd2i&personalfinance&maxbone&"Just be careful about food. I justified moving out as being cheaper because splitting the rent 4 ways and no expensive-ass meal plan meant a big chunk of savings. However, with house-mates never keeping the kitchen clean, and not having a lot of confidence or experience cooking even basic meals, I wound up eating out ALL THE TIME. This wound up costing me way more than I saved in having no meal plan.

I suggest learning to like washing dishes, and finding 2 or 3 go-to recipes that you can make for the week. (My preference is my man-mash: lentils, rice, ground turkey, black beans, salsa, whateverthefuck).

Some like clean shaven some like full beards some like long as beards or twisty tiled mustaches. a percentage of girls like most every appearance so don't reject yourself before she does. You and people may think you look average but you may be a 10, physically, in her eyes. You never know.

What I mean to say is it's only profitable for you if you can get enough units sold, or get a high enough price, and it's only worth it to your (potential) buyers, if you can give them the lower price, which means you might benefit from a system like what MassDrop does.

Max helped others in the challenges and put others first which the other three never really did, and most of the other contestants outside of the show seem to really like her. That one comment changed a lot of people's minds about her though as well as the editing.

Katya and Jaidynn have been genuinely friendly to everyone. But I don't think they put anyone else first. And with Jaidynn it seemed as if more people were bringing her up.

Fame was supportive of Katya and is really sweet. However I wouldn't say she was very congenial during the spoof challenge, mostly towards Pearl.

cqugd7f&conspiracy&Puupsfred&"+ Tx fees are part of Bitcoin as always, if you are willing to wait a few confirmations more then usual, you can even forego those, since many miners dont care and still process 0 fee transactions. I also see no reason why tx fees will rise anytime in the future, the opposite is the case with rising competition among miners.  
+ Regulation of Bitcoin will happen but only in the sense and scope that already covers all transactions in the legal economy of any jurisdiction. BTC is like digital cash. They can only force you to give up your BTC or transact according to their rules as long as you stay within their ""white"" economy. If you want to hide your BTC, buy stuff the government doesnt want you to or give money to people they dont like, there is nothing they can do to hinder you.   
+ Thats the beauty of Bitcoin: all transactions are visible but nobody knows to whom those txs belong, until you come out and tell them that they belong to you. I you want to stay anonymous, just use one of the many mixers or mixing protocols on top of Bitcoin to completely obfuscate your transactions and no 3 letter agancy can track your finances, as tried and failed by the FBI during the Silk Road 1 bust and their inability to track BTCs in Silk Roads tumbler.

Danny sits there with a blank look and says ""I don't know"". She prompts him again by asking how he gets liquid into his body when he's thirsty. Danny replies, ""I don't know."" She is amazingly frustrated by this point and goes as far to ask ""Danny, how do you get water into your body when you're thirsty?"" and he replies, ""I don't know. Through your skin, maybe?""

She freaks out and loses her shit. He's sitting there looking dazed as always and Mrs. Teacher charges to the back of the room and grabs his arm. She pulls him out of his seat and drags him to the front of the classroom where there was a sink.  The water gets turned on and she shoves his arm into the stream and keeps yelling at him ""Through the skin?? THROUGH THE SKIN!?  How are you feeling now? Are you getting full? Are you getting enough water? YOU DRINK WATER WITH YOUR MOUTH!""

The best is seeing a person use the wall to lean on and their forearm to lift up their belly and they just piss hoping they are making it in. Its really disturbing, I can't imagine getting to that point and still shoving your mouth full of food and not exercising.

Yet I bought the supplies, and now I'm cross-stitching my first Pikachu (certaintly won't be the last).

cqugd94&web_design&TheBigLewinski&"Couple things. First, ""E-commerce site"" says pretty much nothing. Amazon is an e-commerce site; so is etsy or ebay or NewEgg. They're vastly different, enterprise-grade challenges.

Second, $5k in the LA area is not that much money. You have to figure that ""Knows what they're doing"" *starts* about a $50 an hour and ideally goes for around double that. For agencies -the walls which talent is hidden behind- easily goes for 50%-100%+ *that* amount. A $5k budget won't even show up on their radar. 

The best way to save money, or to operate with a $5k budget, is to construct a ""fill in the blank"" website. This is the usual route of WordPress plus pick a theme which suits you then tweak and launch. Alternatively, of course, you could look for overseas talent at places like odesk. 

For what it's worth, I regularly talk to business owners in the LA area and technical talent is always the hardest to find. While a pile of resumes is just a craigslist ad away, finding business grade developers is another story, for which there are only a handful. 

I would recommend attending some of the numerous developer/designer gatherings which occur in the LA area and meeting them. You have to consider that developers in demand are choosy about their clients -they generally don't respond to craigslist- so it helps to shake hands in person and convince them you would be an awesome client. They're interviewing you just as much as you're interviewing them. "

cqugd9y&fireemblem&Shephen&"In FE 9 more or less everyone is useable do to bexp and weapon forges. So you can go through the game and just use who ever you like with no problems. There is the big 5 though which is Marcia, Titania, Oscar, Jill and Kieran who are the best units in FE9 for the most part. I will say Zihark is pretty cool, but he isn't to great in the scheme of things in FE9. Worst unit though would probably be Rolf though if you don't count Bastian and Lucia.

Just use them to patch up the units your using or get some going. Though in FE9 people like saving all of them for the last chapter to make sure they get the transfers they want for RD. PoR isn't a hard game at all and you wont need to use them.

Yeah only 1 support between a pair per chapter. 

Depends. Statistically units will be stronger if they get to 20 unpromoted. Though promoting early isn't to bad in a lot of cases. Healers are staffed locked and have pretty terrible exp gains so they will level up slowly which makes 20 unpromoted take a long time. There is also the promo bonuses which can cover for the lost of a few levels in some cases. Also the move boost that units get is pretty great and may warrant an early promotion on that alone. But it is your playstyle and you can promote whenever you feel like it."

cqugdaw&chiliadmystery&KuztomX&"Yeah, it looks like this is the root script that triggers all other scripts upon 100% completion.  What I can see is that the ambient_Ufos script gets loaded, which starts ambient zones get loaded two UFOs (assuming the fort one and the FIB camp one).  Those scripts show the UFOs, and do things like ensure that when you get close in a vehicle, a force is applied to push you away.  It also makes sure the special ""evil death ray"" audio (as they call it) gets played.

It also seems that this triggers UFO_EYE, which is the special script that has a conditional ambient zone for the 3rd UFO, the one above the mountain.  That has it's own script because it only triggers when you get close enough, and in the right conditions.

There is no ambient zone or script for the sunken UFO as it seems to be just a model and nothing more.

Unfortunately, what I have NOT seen yet is code which lets you *interact* with these UFOs. The more I comb through this stuff, the more I fear that we have truly found all that can be found... "

As for Scandrick, I'm probably the one taking the hardest line on him. I just don't agree with holding out when you have four years left on your contract. You ain't Revis, and you picked safety over a chance at big money. Sorry you're playing well now, but if I'm playing poker, fold, and the last card would have hit my hand, I don't get to say ""wait, let me back in, I would have won that money.""

- Sanitation: Dead bodies are disgusting to us because they can spread disease

- Predation prevention: Dead bodies will attract predators to the camp, endangering the living members

- Religious: Since early humans didn't just dump someone in a hole to bury them (they were laid down in a particular way, often accompanied with tools/weapons/artifacts), it is believed that they had the primitive belief in an afterlife, so there was a ceremony associated with burying the dead, potentially also burying those valuable assets thinking they would need it later."

cqugddm&synthesizers&Masturb_Chyiff&"Yeah, it comes with 10 of them in yellow. It also a cool synth because it teaches you to let go - did a patch, had fun with it, and then you reset everything to make something new. Because of this it actually encourages experimentation. 

Its inability to store patches is also its main drawback as it makes for a poor stage synth - you can only use it for one sound during your performance. Even though I've seen many big name artists use original ones on stage many people people ""grow out"" of them and move on to more advanced digital or digitally controlled synths. 

Here are some actually some cool tips for it, which also show additional capabilities of the thing: https://youtu.be/jglbXy2tN20?list=PL2Y43eupOAVWhx_1j_VdvpYArHulB0c7m

Here is an official Korg demo that shows that it also can sound smooth: https://youtu.be/fSnzCWA_JWI

Another thing to mention: You seem fairly new to this synth game. So I just wanted to point out that many times synths are being paired with reverb and delay, just like in the video you found. It gives them more body and spaciousness. If you'll find your synth sounding ""stale"" and you use an amp you can also get a Zoom MS-70CDR pedal which features decent emulations of many popular effects.

Just don't get fixed on effects pedals and shit. A proper synth can actually fake many of them. Or more like a good synth programmer can. Just focus on learning synthesis and you will achieve great results. Don't worry if you can get good or memorable sounds out of your synth at first - it will come with experience. And don't think you've reached the limits of the synth - there is always more.

PS: As an example of a latter statement, I got my hands on one of them Volca Keys synths and to me it seemed more like a toy - a very simple and limited synth. I thought: not much can be done with it. And then: https://youtu.be/0WpZZjy8MkU, https://youtu.be/__C4pICe83U and https://youtu.be/GYLRtWk9wgE."

Gave it a lovely flaky almost pie-crust texture very similar to the crust I had when I ate at Lou Malnatti's. Dammit now I want pizza.

cqugdga&allthingsprotoss&vhapteR&"G1 - You don't scout the spire. You don't go up to *at least* 6 gates initially after expanding (7-10 if you're not teching at all; normally you'd go up to at least 6-8 if you're focusing on tech, or 8-10 if you're making a whole bunch of stalkers). You don't do a poke to force units upon seeing nothing but drones early on and your blink is very late because of opened stargate. Normally, I expand off of 3 gate + forge with 6-8 sentries when I do this build, no stargate. You can do a stargate opener, but the proxy makes it harder to defend against mutas too. You need to scout and have a response to mutas, be it phoenixes or a gateway attack with blink behind it.


G3 - You're trying to do a weird blink all in, expect... you're actually not doing an all in at all. That's too many gates if you're going to take a third. You should take quick third if you're not doing an all in and you just want to go blink sentry. What I do is go zealot, go up to 3 gates while making sentries nonstop, double gas at natural, forge, then move out once warp gate finished to take a third with a whole bunch of sentries and +1 attack behind it. You make a cannon, then add 3+ gates and a twillight council. You can go up to 7-10 gates if you want more blink stalkers, or stay on 6 gates and add a robo, then go up to 8 gates after you move out and then 10 gates later. Watch this vod if you want to see the build in more detail, I stole it from top pros like herO and Rain, but this is basically the same. http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/sc2-strategy/481008-french-pvz-guide


By the way, I think you need storm earlier against zerg. You're playing a turtle style with non late game units, which isn't that good. I recommend attacking more often to see if you can snipe their 4th and stuff, relying on force fields and recall to stay safe. Then constantly send hallucinated phoenixes and if you see roach hydra + hive tech, tech to storm asap imo."

cqugdgc&tf2&ThaZatzke&"Basically if they flick instantaneously and get a headshot, and *return* their aim to where they were originally, ya gots a hacker.

And I'm talking instantaneous. Like, they're aiming somewhere, flick immediately and lock onto to someone's head in 1 frame, shoot, and return their aim in the next frame. If a sniper takes even a measureable amount of time to flick onto target, they're probably legit, solely because most hacks aren't programmed with a delay between flicking and landing a headshot.

And the spectate system in TF2 is really weird. You'll see a sniper aim very obviously below or above someone's head, but they'll get a headshot. From my understanding, this is because the server doesn't show you exactly where people are aiming when scoped, but show you a rough approximation. 

Lag does come into play as well. If you see someone shoot where the target *used* to be, and they score a headshot, they're lagging a bit. (this is actually how people regularly headshot you around corners)."

cqugdhr&AskReddit&[deleted]&The reason we have different restrooms lies on our biological differences, not our psychological differences. 
cqugdhs&comicbooks&rufio_vega&"Despite what many think, the story of Civil War isn't about secret identities. Few key Marvel characters actually maintain a strict secret identity in the modern era. Many, like Cap, abandoned them years ago. The story *is* about the changing views of the audience, traditional superhero characters and stories versus modern tastes and sensibilities.

Prior to the Standford incident, superheroes were largely unofficially recognized by local, state, or federal government. Vigilantism is technically illegal, especially in a manner most superheroes (be they Marvel or DC) carry themselves. And they also commit crimes like assault, battery, and even criminal confinement.

We the audience and many people in the stories accept this as part of superheroics. Cops let the behavior slide because it is seen as a benefit to society. But the Stanford incident changed perception of this behavior in the Marvel U.

Tony understood the changing political climate and predicted that the populace would not tolerate traditional superheroics any longer. His support and leadership of the Registration Act was the logical evolution of heroes in this new world. It would allow heroes to do what they do best, but in an official capacity the people they claim to want to protect approve of. It was a necessary change that had to happen.

Cap, however, stood against it as a matter of personal rights and freedoms being attacked. That traditional ways were working just fine and one incident should not change this. His realization and surrender at the end of the story is rooted in how he finally realized that he was wrong. That he and his supporters were being rather selfish in their war.

Tony fought for change and the desires of the people. Cap and his team were fighting against change for their own selfish views and wants. The needs of the many versus the needs of the few.

Of course, the resulting infighting and chaos proved to be the end goal of the Skrull faction who wanted to weaken the bonds of the superhero community in order to successfully invade and conquer Earth. But this hardly changes the personal views of characters like Tony and Steve."

There are some consistency issues, though. With the right cards in hand, you can make some great plays, but the deck lacks draw power (Galactic Chartiy exists, but it's not great). Beckoning Light is a pretty good card in the deck, as are any cards that let you get Knight back in hand. 

It's one of my favorite archetypes, though, simply because of how satisfying it is to spam Rank 8s and then use Number 62's effect to gain 200x all the Rank on board. I was playing against my friend's Gimmick Puppets the other day and 62 got to 9K in two of our three duels. So much fun."

For example, a lie would be 'they only care about GG style free speech'. Given the amount of time they spend mocking GG, that one is particularly hilarious. I'm going to assume you've never seen any of their discussions with Milo Yiannopolous (sp?) or the GG guy who wanted to sue Blockbot? Both of those, by the way, directly contradict your assertion. So does the blog post that they wrote about GG - https://popehat.com/2014/10/26/ten-short-rants-about-gamergate/

The really funny part of this is that you argue just like a Gamergater- or a Republican yelling about Benghazi.

cqugdj9&HyruleWarriors&HylianAngel&"Amiibos are physical figurines that you can [buy from retail stores](https://www.nintendo.com/amiibo).

On the title screen of Hyrule Warriors, you can place an Amiibo on the bottom-left corner of your Wii U Game Pad to receive a free gift. You can scan up to 5 Amiibos per day.

* Link Amiibo / Toon Link Amiibo: Unlocks Link’s Spinner weapon. Subsequent uses will give you a Link weapon with 3+ stars.
* Zelda Amiibo: Gives you a Zelda weapon with 3+ stars.
* Sheik Amiibo: Gives you a Sheik weapon with 3+ stars.
* Ganondorf Amiibo: Unknown as of this date, but presumably, it should give you a Ganondorf weapon with 3+ stars.
* Other Amiibos: Gives you Rupees, Materials, or a random weapon.

Normally, the Zelda-related Amiibos will grant you a rank 3 weapon for that specific character. However, Amiibos cannot grant you weapons you have not unlocked. For example, if you have a Sheik Amiibo, and you’ve only unlocked Sheik’s rank 2 weapon (Typhoon Harp), you will only receive Typhoon Harps from your Sheik Amiibo. You must unlock Sheik’s rank 3 weapon (Triforce Harp) from the Adventure Map before your Sheik Amiibo can give you Triforce Harps.

And if you haven’t unlocked Zelda, Sheik, or Ganondorf as characters, their corresponding Amiibos will give you a random prize as if they were a normal Amiibo.

You receive an ingame Medal for scanning 100 Amiibos called the Amiibo Warriors Medal."

cqugdke&financialindependence&executivepower&"I drive an R53 MINI Cooper S that I bought when it was 9 years old, well maintained, low mileage, paid cash. Not entirely the most economical decision as they have middle of the road reliability and middle of the road fuel economy, but as a car enthusiast it would pain me to drive something like a Honda Fit. The MINI represents a nice balance between driver's car and economy car considering the supercharger, brilliant steering feel, racing competitiveness, and passable fuel efficiency. I also work on my own car and like to tinker, so the car is relatively cheap to maintain and relatively cheap to modify for a bit more power. In the end, I couldn't be happier even though I spent a few extra bucks, but recognize that this was a worthwhile trade off for me whereas it may not have been for others with different skill sets and interests.

That said, I have always driven enthusiast cars bought used that were well maintained. I usually drive them for a year or so and then sell them.

cqugdmq&buildapc&capn_hector&"If you have a Microcenter nearby, you can get a $40 discount on a mobo if you buy a 4690K at the same time.  The MSI Z97 PC Mate is a great choice for single GPU (the 4x second slot will do Crossfire, it's not ideal, but it cannot do SLI) - very good capability for the price, particularly after the $40 off.  That would shave $60 off your build.

I'd also consider a cheap liquid cooler instead of a fan unit - you can pick up 120mm/140mm units for around $40 AR fairly frequently.  If you're not overclocking and want to save, the stock cooler will probably be fine, if you're overclocking it might be nice to move up."

cqugdnl&AskMen&sumg&"Well according to [this polling data](http://www.gallup.com/poll/164618/desire-children-norm.aspx), the desire to have kids hasn't changed all that much in recent years.  I'd wager most people's anecdotal experience skews their perception of how many people wanted kids from their youth.

Remember, when you (or anyone) was growing up, you were almost wholly surrounded by people who wanted to be surrounded by kids.  You didn't see many of the people that didn't want kids because they did not want to be around you.  That can create a false perception that a disproportionate amount of people want to have kids eventually.

When you reach adulthood, you see all the people that don't want kids because they aren't actively avoiding you anymore.  That could account for some of the perceived change.

cqugdra&LifeAfterNarcissism&theaftstarboard&I like the concept of roleplay/daydream/characterplay a lot. That way  I can kind of act out some of the abuse that occurred to me and then release it. I have a stuffed animal that I talk to. In a way, this stuffed animal has always been a surrogate parent. It's one of the few things I've always had from my childhood. This animal I think, embodies the things that I never had. I also sometimes go into character in games with characters that represent the ways I've suffered. Either they have no parents, or abusive parents, or they have some kind of physical scars to represent the abuse they suffered at the hands of their guardians, or their only friend is an animal or they talk to animals better than people. Since one of my main problems is eye-related (from the fact I never had eye surgery as a child because my parents are so cheap - its called amplyopia and stigmatism as well as I have a lot of floaters from the stress- imagine lots of different sized grains always floating in front of your vision) one of my characters is half-blind...it sort of helps me embody it I think. Like gravestones are markers, my characters are too.

cqugdrg&BabyBumps&thatpurplegirl&"I think you can safely purchase most of your larger items like cribs, dressers, car seat if your family hasn't already talked of gifting you those things. 

If someone does throw you a shower you could add some large bonus items like a stroller or glider, things you may not need immediately but would be nice along with all the little things baby needs (clothes, diapers, toys, etc).

I feel like having the physical nursery done asap is important to me but the diaper creams and toys can wait for a shower. 

I should add that they may want to throw a shower once baby is born to meet your little person since you're a decent distance away. Maybe slide it into casual conversation that

cqugdsc&askscience&UlrichSD&"Mostly right, few minor clarifications.  Most asphalt roads don't have concrete underneath, BOC (Bituminous over concrete) is actually kinda rare, and nearly always a retrofit to an in place concrete road in need to work, as it is far cheaper than a full reconstruct or concrete overlay.  Decisions on pavement structure are actually super complicated.  Anyway the base of most roadways is aggregate, aggregate is actuality a really strong material in thick enough layers.  

Another repair that can be used is mud jacking.  A hole is drilled through the pavement down to the cavity under the pavement.  Grout is pumped into the voids repairing the structure.  The pavement can then be patched and a overlay to improve the ride.  

Pavement repair in general is actually pretty complicated and constantly evolving field.  

Pavements are not really my field, but I studied it enough in school and work with pavement engineers (I deal with getting the cars arround on the pavement), so I've picked up a few things.  "

I smell like a well-dressed salad until I rinse it out, but damn, does my hair get silky smooth!  (For shampoo and conditioner, I use the aveeno sulfate-free ones.  I use the conditioner only after the oil, but both on days I don't do oil.) And, with the oil it goes into these perfect and well-defined ringlets instead of a wavy, frizzy blob.  I don't take the time often, but when I do it's well worth it.  I have heard good things about coconut oil for hair but have never tried it myself.  

I have heard of hair texture changing as you age, but going from straight to curly must be a huge adjustment.  My sister's is doing that a bit; she's gone from straight to increasing waviness in the past 3 or 4 years (she's 35 now) even though she's let it get longer and longer.

cqugdw1&AskReddit&condimentorice&Turns out crucifixions and Christianity both rose from ancient human sacrifices intended to enbue the wood with protective energies. Jesus was a great witch who linked with a full coven and sacrificed himself, granting protective powers to the essence of the cross rather than just one. Witches then created Christianity to convince people to wear the protective charms long after they had forgotten about the vampire monsters the crosses were created to protect us from.

It is not guilt tripping or taking for granted to be our obligation. That's only if we want to interpret it that way.

The point is to realize that we are all small players under a bigger power. Even if we have beef with each other, it will be against our interests to not align and at least provide some minimal support. Normal rules of reciprocating revenge does make sense here. Normally, when someone is bad towards us, we will be bad towards them. But that's only for a game with equal players. Now is a game with skewed players, so the reciprocating revenge rules should be suspended or applied less.

Even if it doesn't instantaneously benefit us, an unexpected support will benefit us more because it won't cost us anything, it will generate positive value for someone else who have some set of interests aligned with us, so that we might get a return somewhere down the line. With more of these exchange, we might establish a symbiotic group relationship that will make us both stronger and equalize the game for us."

cqugdzb&MLS&spisska&"It's an exercise in semantics showing that you can't say that the average player in league X makes the average wage in league X. That's what OP said, and that's what I've been refuting.

More broadly, talking about averages with a set like salaries is only useful at the collective level, and largely meaningless at the level of individuals.

Try this on: The average salary in MLS is higher than the J-League, but the average J-league player earns more than the average MLS player.

Can that be true?

Yes, and I think it actually *is* true. DPs in MLS skew the average up, so while the average in MLS might be higher than the J-League, the median in the J-League might be higher than MLS. 

If you're a player with a choice of one or the other, and you care about getting a higher wage, which do you chose?"

cqugdzm&worldnews&mrv3&"Britain is rebuilding it's empire using covert agents from within Government.

Is a statement, you probably disagree.

In a debate it'd be my job to convince you. By stating my opinion I am not convincing you unless you share my perspective, as stated I didn't share it. I wanted his sources which allowed him to come to his conclusion so I can re-evaluate myself.

The danger of having to do your own research based on the opinions of others is your own inherent bias effecting how you respond to it. The evidence which convinced them should help convince or at the very least self-question.

Another danger is my opinion, a part of me, something which Google knows about so if the thing is up for debate I will receive sources I WANT, not the sources I should find.

And finally, the reason I prefer getting a source is the additional depth. We have opinions on facts, regardless of their absoluteness we all have different opinions many of which are far too long on complex to type out, by posting the sources and further reading if a replier is truly interested in debate they can see my expanded viewpoint easily with a well researched backing to better explain why I feel this way.

For example.

I believe 9/11 was an inside job.

Now firstly, if you Googled that you'd get a miriad of different websites claiming different things with different sources and more importantly a casm of differing definitions of inside job and to the extent and level. Now you could find backing up, but you're opinion wouldn't change because of the variety and your own personal bias which already knows such a thing exsists.

Now if I where to state my opinion in-depth with facts and sources backing up that exact position you'd get a better picture of my perspective allowing you to participate in a debate in which we can convey our own conclusions and the underlying evidence behind them. Hopefully with one of us changing their perspective.

If you did your own personal research you'd find plenty of sources but highly doubt you'd come to the same conclusion and certainly wouldn't change your perspective.

SO I want you to discredit my first statement about Britain rebuilding an empire. You can't provide your source and you must research mine.

cquge1l&MLS&Dashdar&"OK..sry I have to make my reply quick because I have company coming.

**1st point: I agree. MLS players are not valued a high as others and the global market reflects that. What I took from the Twitter post was less about global market value, and more about how much money a team was willing/allowed to invest in players.
**
That's really what drives the global market too right? As Barca, Real Madrid, Man U, Bayern, etc. battle it out for a GREAT player, his price will rise. 

So if a MLS team was willing/allowed to invest more money into its players, they could have more players with a higher perceived value (like what if the All-Star team was a team). The hope being that this would improve their overall quality and depth. 

**Tangent**: I'm not against this, I do worry that it would unbalance the teams and make the league less enjoyable overall, but that's just based on my personal viewing preference. But it would help in some of these international competitions...

**2nd point**: Yes. Higher salaries like those of CEOs and DPs will always naturally skew a figure higher when talking about Averages and it should always be questioned when someone presents you with such a figure. "

Allah will Question us all and based on our deeds and who we are, we will be rewarded or punished. I'm not a scholar, and I don't know much, but I know we are responsible for our lives. What you do is between you and Allah. I have no right to ask you why, or day you'll be punished for it, when in fact Allah may very well find something He likes in you.

cquge4y&DebateReligion&[deleted]&"I'm not disagreeing with your sentiment, but I think *Isma* is giving an accurate account of her faith.   Under Catholicism you can't just say something is so because *you* think it is so.  

If you take it out of the *gay marriage* context, I think you will understand and maybe even appreciate Catholic sentiment.  As an example, the Parliament of England by [Act of Supremacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy) declared Henry VIII head of the Church of England.  I think most people probably already know the story, and how it was just a ploy to allow Henry to annul his marriage with Catherine so he could marry Anne Boleyn.  *Saint* Thomas More was canonized (at least partly) because he would not take the Oath of Supremacy, believing Parliament had no jurisdiction over issues which were God's alone.  More said,  ""no temporal man may be the head of the spirituality."" He was beheaded.  The significance is that secular authority has no power over spiritual authority."

Sadly, living at home doesn't free me from socially conservative parents. Since I rather they not find out while I am living with them (and before I am financially stable), I was leaning more towards just doing the therapy part where we talk to someone so we could get that letter of recommendation for the hormones. Plus, I am part time so not much money coming in when I am hoping to go back to school this year or next. 

As with above, hair removal treatment will have to wait until I am able to move out.

Already neck deep in an female-identified online personality - haven't been male at all online unless I need to be - mainly for online courses I paid for. Strangely, I don't remember being treated like shit; although I rarely speak and mostly go solo in MMOs.

My voice, as we talked about in the smaller response, I will have to work on. I am still looking for a style - mainly because I dunno what would be in the middle of princess and tomboy.

Lastly, I love the analogy you made! I originally thought the girl I am was already out, but to go along with your analogy she was probably  just half way down the tower.

Thank you for the luck! \^^

cqugeaf&vegan&Vishika&"I'm not sure whether morality plots nicely along a continuum, i'd say it's very complicated. Even if you reject intention and only consider outcomes.
I think what you mean is that the amount of suffering could be plotted along a continuum, but this gets quite complicated as we all can struggle at times when deciding which harm is worse than others.
Took me a while to understand your last sentence. You're saying that not only should [we] make the choice to eat the best thing possible at present, but we can also seek the best.
Yep that's fair, I didn't mean to imply that your framework didn't support constant improvement, I only meant to point out that it's unlikely in this economy (dominated by capitalism) that say grain production will ever evolve to be farmed veganically if we stop eating it all together and get our calories form say honey (ignore the details of the simplification).

But I think my point still stands that under your framework you are obliged to find and locate the best minimal set (can include variety as long as they are of the same level) of nutritionally complete calorie sources and only consume that.

Doesn't really seem that practical as each local[e] will have a different set depending on which crops they can grow etc. There will also be differing opinions about what's healthy.
That's why veganism isn't just a philosophy, political statement, but also comes with guidelines to make it easy to follow practically.
We simply can't have a cohesive baseline under your framework, imagine how much dissent there would be at a potluck. :P"

cqugebe&ReefTank&meth_lab_for_cutie&"I got this sump as part of a good deal for a few tanks and stands from a friend who couldn't keep them anymore.  

It has got a small protein skimmer (big enough for my tank) built in.  I'm torn between setting up a 37g reef using this sump tank (If I can ever find a replacement tank that fits this stand…) and just getting one of the 29g biocubes where everything is contained in the back of the tank.

Obviously the biocube sounds a lot easier, but I don't mind some extra work.  Hell, I already own the sump tank, so I'd really like to use it because I know they aren't exactly cheap and I don't want to waste it.  Of course I could just save it for when I have room for a bigger tank...  

My options for my first reef tank are pretty much the following:

1) buy new glass, a pump, bio media, and plumbing for the sump.  (I'd love a bigger tank but a 29-40g would be about all I can fit in my apartment.)

or

2) just go for the 29g biocube where all of the filtration is built in.

It will cost close to the same to go either way.  I just can't decide if it's worth trying to make what I already have work or just doing with something entirely different.

I'll admit I'm very new to saltwater and reef keeping.  I've always been a freshwater guy.  Will i significantly benefit from using the sump in my setup if I'm willing to put in the work to make sure everything is proper?"

Unless the tires you have are relatively new in wear, it's recommended that you replace minimum two tires, and put them on the front for a front wheel drive. Sure, you can get away with less, but it's not safe if there's a significant difference in wear.

As for where, I always get my tires from Discount Tire. They have a good selection, can get others they don't have in stock, and you can get a final price without any surprise add ons. In my area, they have four tires in stock that size, one of the brands being a Kumho for $50 each."

I'm 15 years old, I try to collect amiibo as best as I can, I'm not a NiB collector as I like to spend time with my little brother training (Note: Smash is the only game we play) them with my little brother up to level 50 and put them on our own amiibo tournaments. It's a hobby we both share. Sadly, because of Nintendo and it's attitude for Amiibo, I nor my brother are able to get amiibo we most want, Ike being one that my brothers want and Shulk the one I want (My dick friend bought a $30 Shulk from Amazon fully knowing that I wanted him and couldn't get him, he gloated about it for a week and is now gloating about his greninja). All the amiibo I have I bought with my own money (I used to work in a pizzaria shop because my father was good friends with the owner but they recently closed so I dont have a job anymore) I got extremely lucky with my unicorns (they were hidden behind some skylanders in Walmart), my parents are Mexican so they don't give a damn about my obsession with amiibo, heck they don't care about my hobbies, they also will NOT buy me anything that is video game related, I had to save up for everything(me and my sister together saved up for a Wii U). I was lucky with Captain Falcon, he was super cheap ($15) on Amazon and I bought him without my dad's permission. He got pissed but not too pissed. Either way, I just spent my last 60 dollars on wave 4 for me and my brother, didn't have enough for Charizard or Wario that was money I saved up for splatoon but both me and my brother wanted the new wave. Again, my chances of winning is slim but in the rare case you pick me, my brother would like the Ike and give the WFT to someone who really wants it. Again I really appreciate you for doing this giveaway, it always gives me a bit of hope in my heart.

cqugeee&nexus6&Rickles360&I am.  I trust google to provide a better user experience than some team of after school hackers.  Things like enabling a half baked double tap to wake feature or disabling encryption that provides no perceptually discernable performance gain are not interesting to me.  What is interesting is a swift clean and stable experience and stock nexus has always been about delivering those ideals. On my S3 it was necessary to root to get away from touchpiss but on the nexus 6 there's no reason to bother.  Its much more effort then its worth even if the mod devs can actually provide a marginally better experience.

cqugeeg&Patriots&SamTheSnowman&Biggest question of the night: Where is Leon Sandcastle going?
cqugeeh&nfl&mrhashbrown&"The same reason why people aren't overreacting to Mariota's 2 INTs. I guess teams think each QB's performances were all about the kind of system they were in.

We saw Foles run a similar system as Mariota/Oregon in the NFL and finish with only 2 INTs one season, but the next season his INT count was much higher. Teams know that if they run a spread system similar to what Mariota was in, they probably aren't going to see his insane TD-INT ratio because NFL defenses have rapidly evolved.

Now take a look at Winston. Teams know what to expect from him because he was in a true pro system, and he finished with 25 TDs to 18 INTs. Which means teams are probably expecting roughly the same kind of performance in his rookie NFL season. If he does have 25-18 again, that would put him in a very similar range as the rookie seasons of Luck, Wilson, and Dalton - all three of which led their teams to playoff appearances."

Have you thought about changing your cleanser and moisturizer? That might help with the redness too. I use CeraVe foaming cleanser but they also make a hydrating.

On the make-up front, I use Revlon Photoready Concealer and Everyday Minerals powder foundation. I've heard Meow cosmetics powder foundation is also really great (they have light, medium, and heavy coverage formulas) which I'm going to test out soon.

cqugefr&AskReddit&salty_bananas&"The day my mother died suddenly, I found out that both she and my dad had been married before. On top of this, the ""cousin"" that used to come visit us when I was a child was actually my half-sister! She had stopped coming around, but I always liked her and wished she would come back. Sad part is, even my father had lost track of his own daughter (long story involving the secret they were keeping from me, a marriage and subsequent move and then divorce of my half-sister) and he hadn't able to locate her for years. Happy ending - 18 years after my mom's death, my sister contacts me out of the blue, we meet up for a tearful reunion, and shortly afterwards, father and daughter are reunited at last! We all love each other dearly and love to get together (we each live in different states.)  "

cqugeg3&DCcomics&DerringerHK&"I enjoyed the movie but didn't like how Ultron was handled. At the beginning, Ultron came across as a really intimidating villain. By the end, he just became a walking punchline (a la Loki in Avengers). Getting beat up by Hulk mid-sentence and having him defeated by a single member of the Avengers kind of negated any of the tension the film had built up surrounding the character.

Also, kind of disappointed with how Quicksilver was outed. Bit lame.

Besides these two things I quite enjoyed it, though I think it's inferior to the first.

Oh, also why the fuck was Stellan Skarsgard even in the film? I feel like they cut out a few scenes.

cqugegc&Advice&erumstead&"I think this is common in long distance relationships when there is no end in sight to the 'long distance' part. From your post, it sounds like you are thinking about this relationship as a potential permanent partnership rather than as something more casual/just for fun. The scary thing about that is that means you're a ways away from your goal in the relationship--a long-term commitment. If it doesn't feel like you're progressing toward that goal, that can make you question the relationship. Your relationship might seem stagnant right now. It sounds like the two of you have reached a point where you are very emotionally intimate, so that part of your relationship isn't developing much over time anymore. Because you're in an open-ended LDR, your relationship also isn't developing much physically or in terms of practical commitments (""after I finish school, we'll move together to city X,"" etc.).

Do you think that is what the problem is, or am I way off base? (Be honest.)"

cqugej1&Screenwriting&you_are_temporary&"I believe one prominent reason that horror movies tend to be ""bad"" is that it's difficult to get characters into the desired scary situations in a believable way. 


I think horror, moreso than most other genres, is subject to more intense scrutiny in terms of the audiences willingness to suspend disbelief.  ""Cops wouldn't do that,"" ""I wouldn't do that,"" ""yeah going alone is a great idea,"" and other thoughts like these are common reactions to typical horror flicks because writers have to come up with ways of getting people into strange circumstances. 


That, and the fact that they have a more easily achievable albeit ""cheap"" way of giving audiences the indented thrills. You can't get tears without some serious emotional connection to the story, but you can ""scare"" the shit out of someone at ANY time with fast cuts and loud noises.

The retail and digital versions cost 4,700 ($39.25, probably $39.99 in the US), and the DLC will set you back another 2,000 yen ($16.70, probably $19.99).

cqugel0&LosAngeles&dji386&I did 110 miles a day for two years on a motorcycle, Downtown Riverside to Old Town Pasadena. I would recommend against getting a scooter and instead get a regular motorcycle. You'll be higher up and are easier to see and have the power to get out of a bad situation when it comes up. Get a bike with heated grips. Be prepared to buy both winter and summer gear. Wear your gear at all times, no exceptions. If you don't have your M1 license already, take the MSF course. As for a bike, I can't recommend a Honda NC700x enough. It was designed from the ground up for commuting. You can never get comfortable/complacent on a bike. You have to know where everyone is around you at all times.  I had a good time commuting via bike, but it was still a commute. After two years I was burned out and moved closer.

It seems like a useless word if you are correct, so I think I'll need a source to believe your claim.

That is to say, there is a large difference between your examples: you are comparing three words, person/people/peoples (edit: arguably four, counting persons, which is usually now replaced by people), to two words, fish/fishes."

I have $40k worth of student loan debt. But because I got a degree I have an entry level position making $62k annually. If you say that I should have not gone to college and instead become a garbage collector or an equally horrific job, I'd tell you to fuck off.

Some people don't need to go to college, but that division is based on intelligence and work ethic, not on income. And not everyone is able to work during college, myself included. "

You think trans people aren't insecure? A trans girl in a girls lockerroom would be very insecure and probably keep to themselves more than a lesbian.

cqugeou&IAmA&brightest-night&"Simple trait that's as old as Hollywood itself. It's called acting and even most directors can do it well because they exist around it all the time. 

It's easy to pretend to be nice…as Vince mentioned, that's part of the gig and it's only part time. And to be honest, that's all the fans deserve is a part-time look at who you are if you're in the public eye. A few minutes here and there out of a month's worth of time. 

It's easy to be grateful and nice whenever you're being approached by people who love you for what you've created and who only want to express their love of that work. It would take a special kind of asshole to not act favorably toward those people. And we've seen it before, it's usually from very, very *very* wealthy people who just end up losing that patience and don't mind losing a few hundred fans here and there and who can afford to.

For everyone else? Yes…you can be crazy and angry all over the place, just not publicly and in front of gracious fans."

cqugeq0&smashbros&RevolverRed&"Unfortunately, all of my friends who play Smash either have the 3ds version or don't play competitively. Or both. So I have to resort to online, but even then, I can't find one. It won't make anything different, I already KNOW what I have to work on and idk why people keep telling me to watch for what I should work on. I'd LOVE to get better at my neutral game with spot dodges or whatever needs to be done, but time doesn't work for me. At all. 

I'll give you an example. Before Smash 4, I never shielded. Like, ever. I just rolled. However, someone told me that shielding is a good option for defense, and so I just did so all the time because it was a press of a button. However, this now leads me to a shielding habit and I get grabbed a lot(I'm also not good at perfect shielding because that requires reaction time and I'm not very good at that). So now I have to learn to spot dodge correctly. 

I already know about observing opponent habits but the problem is this: characters with options. Like legit I don't know what to do against Falcon because he can dash grab, dash attack, shff Nair, shff dair, feint side b, or empty hop grab. Its ridiculously hard and right now I'm stuck gambling that I can make the right decision."

cqugeqf&nba&livexwire2014&"Yeah I don't remember the last time we had that kind of prospect. I was in elementary school when pierce was drafted and I honestly though rondo would be terrible in the league. He wasn't had his moments his rookie season but wasn't that great. Celtics fans can only hope for a scenario where Danny cashes in on his chips and do a complete turn around (like 2007). Maybe that's why we get excited when our team is in this mediocrity state where we have lots of assets as well as young promising players. I personally think our contending team will only have smart and thomas (as a role player off the bench). Everyone else is a trade chip with those picks. 

Also, you guys have a really exciting team. I really wish we could get Noel though haha. It would be awesome to get a hometown guy playing for boston. The people here would love him. Embiid could be a beast of a two way player if he stays healthy"

cquger8&guns&cs556&Not to sound like a dick, but I feel like every gun most gun owner I know own is a vanity gun. Reason being is that they own at least one, some of them many guns, and rarely go to the range more than once a year. They also don't carry, or even use them for home defense.  I can't think of any other reason they own them than to look at them and to impress their friends.
cquger9&soccer&Regents_Park&"He's a forward, he's not expected to set the tempo like a CM or play like Hazard and Neymar. You could apply the exact same critique you wrote to Reus and most would still call him a great playmaker.

Sometimes it's almost like Bale is punished for being so much better an athlete than most that people forget that even speed and strength aside he has freakish natural ability. Not as good in tight spaces as Hazard or at close control dribbling as Neymar 

But combine that with the fact that he's 80% (to pick an arbitrary figure) as good as them at those aspects of play (which is still better than the vast majority of players) and add in his freakish athletic ability and he can be just as if not much more effective, dangerous and useful when in good form. 

As Di Maria has shown this year a more traditional, technical playmaker/forward is much less effective than a more athletic one when out of form. "

It's pretty clear that artistic depictions of religious figures and events can completely override the actual source material. They probably had no idea fig trees weren't around at the time when they first started popping up in artwork over hundreds of years. Art is the reason everyone assumes hell is on fire, heaven is in the clouds, angels are people with white eagle wings, god has a long white beard, adam and eve ate an apple, etc. Sometimes common depictions just sort of get in the way of things. Actually a ton of history is skewed in people's heads because they only know of the stereotypical wrong depiction such as the first thanksgiving, Lady Godiva riding naked through the streets, vikings wearing horns on their helmets, etc.

cqugeu8&MensRights&GenderNeutralLanguag&"Is there fair and good reason for it to be an all female workplace?  If your applying to be a nurse, so few nurses are men the probability of an all-female nursing staff at a nursing home or similar is very high.  Even with out any sexism at all, select 10 nurses at random odds are you will get 10 females.

Is it a teacher position?  Again so few early childhood educators are men that it's highly probable to get an all female staff.  You shouldn't take this job because of the pedo-hystiria, not the sexism of the admin.

Her comments in isolation are meaningless.  The simple fact of all female staff is not.  You don't get all female staffs outside of nursing and child care with out significant amounts of sexism.  The admin may not be the sexist bigot, it may be one of the employees that makes the work place hostile to men."

The reason I'm still there is they allow single-topic 'megathreads' which run for thousands of pages - e.g. the boardgame thread or the league of legends thread. Very few places offer that sort of continuous discussion about specific hobbies where you can actually get to know people and it's not *totally* overrun with teenagers.

cqugf1t&rupaulsdragrace&Talenthy&"Urgh... it's hard for me, because I am wondering if my vote for Miss Fame may be my inner-stan influencing the vote. 

On one side, Miss Fame was supportive through Katya's struggles, got Violet out of her shell in episode 5, was very kind and complimentary about other contestants... never lowered herself to rudeness and never meant harm.

On the other hand, Max and Jaidynn were absolute *sweethearts* as well!

I think if I included stuff outside the season, I'd throw my vote with Miss Fame. If I restricted myself to things only said on the season itself, it would be either Max (for building people up) or Jaidynn (for being forever friendly).

Katya also... but the only thing that makes me a *lil* bit hesitant with Katya is that she does tend to kiki with bitchiness and does sometimes come across a bit as Ginger Minj's background vocalist when she's being cunty."

cqugf2x&Pathfinder_RPG&LucienPyrus&"While it depends on the world you are playing, from what I understand in Golarion necromancy pulls souls out of Phrarasma's boneyard before they can be judged. When an undead dies, its soul is destroyed.

The problem is the lesser god Groetus who hangs out above the boneyard. When the last soul is judged, Groetus descends on the boneyard which starts the end times. Pharasma keeps away Groetus by feeding him the souls of atheists. 

So every time you raise the dead you bring the world one step closer to a permanent end. That is why creating undead is evil. 

In general resurrection spells bring the soul back to life and usually is treated as it wasn't the soul's time yet. A resurrected character's soul still goes to the boneyard when it dies.

There are such things as non-undead necromancy. Essentially necromancy spells that don't deal with creating undead deal with the forces of life and death. Stuff like blindness/deafness, bestow curse and disrupt undead are under necromancy. Usually necromancy involves negative energy as well and as long as you aren't using it to heal the undead I don't see a problem with it.

cqugf4g&pics&lkuecrar&"No black Americans don't like to be called black but that's because people like you constantly have to differentiate between white people and black people rather than wanting everyone to just be Americans. Black people EVERYWHERE but in the US like to be called by whatever a citizen of the country they live in is called. I don't care what kind of degree you have--anyone can get one if they have the money to do so, so don't act like you've accomplished anything. What, you want me to apologize for being white? Fuck you and fuck that. I've NEVER done anything against a black person. I have actually heard more horrible stuff from white people than black people, so if I dislike anyone it would be white people. You can shove your Masters degree up your ass for all I care because you're obviously too far gone in white guilt to realize that nobody should be bootlicking any specific race like you're doing. 

Btw, nobody uses the words aggregate and lambasted unless they're digging though a thesaurus trying to sound smart. "

I've played competitive Magic for over a decade, and I've been in many, many different stores. Sometimes, all the stereotypes ring true. But the tournament scene tends to attract the more serious players, and I've found the tournament population is more representative of the wider population. I've played in Magic tournaments and then gone to a bar to watch a punk band play. I've been to giant house parties held ahead of major Magic tournaments and had everybody go to the tournament hungover as shit the next day. I've also discussed anime and video games over casual games of Magic. I've had all kinds of experiences.

I'm sorry you had a bad experience, but please don't use that one experience to judge the entirety of Magic players."

I have read that PAWS can take several months to years to full go away, but have never heard of it taking that long just to set in.  In fact this article from TheFix specifically talks about paws and according to it :

""PAWS symptoms peak around four to eight weeks after quitting""

cqugf6b&roosterteeth&keegan112099&I wouldn't worry too much about it. The viewership will stop declining eventually. I remember about a year ago the yogscast was experiencing the same problem. Viewership was going down and many doomsayers kept on harping about how they're dead and that this will be the end of the yogscast.  But now the yogscast is getting better and better views.  Their viewership is going back up and things are looking pretty good for them.  I think the reason YouTube groups experience this is because people's tastes change over time.  Some people have watched RT since the start but you cant expect that these people will keep watching forever.  People will leave and new people will come.

cqugf73&AskReddit&DJKVesper&"Now this was a recurring dream I had when I was. It usually happens about once a year, and for the life of me can't really explain why but I'll do my best.

I start out in what seems to be the Amazon, like the trees and rivers. But they are Islands similar to the floating ones in Avatar. (I was having these dreams before the films but they are the closest thing visually) .Except the river is very straight, canal like. I'm floating down it as it gets faster and faster. I'm joined but random people I can't recognise, but they are floating down with me. There is no visible floating device. The river is straight but the trees and vines turn around me. Soon this ride takes me off the edge into the longest drop I ever seen. Its an almost perfect circle down, I can see other straight rivers entering from the sides. I fall down, I keep falling for a while. Then fade I to black, when I wake up, I'm wet and I'm down a street. The but there is only 3 houses I see, I'm encapsulated in a box, the blue walls go all around with room to spare. I get out of the gutter and walk to the first house in front of me. I peer through the window. There is a family inside, all happy, like Christmas dinner time. But not, one of the older children turn to look at the window and they see me. She screams, the while family looks over and they start panicking. I get worried and jump back, looking around. There is a mirror just floating between the house. I stand in front of it and look. I can't describe what I see, but it brings me to tears instantly. I cry desperately to this mirror, sobbing into my limbs (sometimes hands, othertimes tentacles, once wood). I sit down on the curb outside these 3 houses still crying where the youngest child comes over to me and puts a hand on my shoulder. At this point, it feels like the camera ending as I can see the child resting the hand on the thing and I pan up into the darkness where I wake up.

I don't know why I have this dream, it happened once to twice a year for majority of my life, not had it for 2 years but it sticks with me still."

cqugf7j&Drugs&Your_Post_Is_Metal&"I think people eat more and less healthily when they smoke because lots of people time their toking very poorly. For example, people smoke in the evening, after dinner. Now you get the munchies, so you eat again. And because you're stoned, you're not likely to eat something healthy but instead have whatever is convenient(junk food). 


I've alleviated this issue with myself by smoking while I cook dinner. I eat a relatively healthy meal right as the munchies kick in, and I am good for the rest of the night. If you time your smoking with your meals, I expect it will be less of a problem. And planning ahead to have healthy snacks around could also help. Have some fruit or something instead of doritos. 




But you're right, it's still not a healthy thing to do every day. "

They were operating under the ""if we live here, its our land"" model of diplomacy and were trying to start their own country. Then the USA purchased/conquered/etc the land from Mexico and things got a little tense for a few years."

It will be interesting to see how missile heavy the final game is. With long trips and deep space exploration it seems like ballistic weapons and missiles will be sort of a luxury to covet and keep for special occasions, where as any pre-planned combat will rely much more heavily on them as they are harder hitting.
  
I guess it comes down to the fact that a fully loaded missile boat is way more threatening pre-combat, but could be a sitting duck afterwards, where as a couple omnisky's will always work."

That's an intangible thing that has been there his entire career. I don't think winning a 6th ring would add much more weight to that than there's already been.

So my argument would still be that winning a ring this year doesn't influence his legacy a huge deal. He's already got a great legacy and in the conversation for ""best big ever"". Getting another ring on a smaller role wouldn't change much. If Malone had gotten his ring with the Lakers, I wouldn't consider it changing his legacy much either."

cqugfb6&AskReddit&ApocaRUFF&"For a lot of people who have asthma, one slight whiff of smoke in the air can cause their airways to get fucked for a couple of hours. Outside it's not so much an issue, you can easily stand so the smoke won't get near you. There are times when you don't notice someone lighting up or you have to walk by them (like on a sidewalk) to get where you're going and then you'll be screwed because it's either walk past them and potentially get a couple of breaths of smoke or just stop. 

But in a car, even with the window open, or in the house next to the stove fan, will still cause issues. Plus the stuff (cigarettes) stinks like ass hole. Pipe tobacco and cigars I can understand as they have decent flavors and can even smell pleasant to those around. But I've never smelt cigarette smoke that didn't make me think of a fat ladies ass.

cqugfbv&emergencymedicine&claerwyn&"Hey hey, as a final year medical student I can confirm that shadowing isn't really something that is done here per se, but there are opportunities down the line to get involved in emergency medicine.

Depending on which medical school you apply to, they will offer a variety of placements, some of which will be in various areas including emergency. That being said, I fell in love with emergency med within the first few years of my degree, but as a medical student we're really good at falling for almost every different type of specialty. I can guarantee that you will change your mind at least 5 times within your first semester at uni. As Mick_kerr's comment, try and enjoy your moment; get involved in the placement you're in. 

If you're also undertaking rural terms, they can provide a really good hands on approach to working in a rural ED, where bulk interesting patients present. 

Medical schools can also offer elective terms in the later years where you might be able to arrange with a particular department in any state to take a term (approx 6-8 weeks) with them. This is normally only later on in the degrees (years 5-6 in undergrad or years 3-4 in postgrad)

tl;dr concentrate on getting in to med school, enjoy the ride and don't forget to party on the weekends.

It looks like you are posting too frequently. /r/PokemonExchange has a rule that states users may only make one post every 36 hours (1.5 days). This ensures that nobody spams the subreddit, and that nobody constantly deletes and reposts their own threads so their threads always appear above other users' threads on the frontpage.

CRUSHED made soaphax mad, made a video (""look atchu man, all u do is gamble""), and made it private because he is the CRUSHED

~~So i ask for Help while in a Classic Duel Server, and he is what happens.
He Doesn't Help, He Randoms and Spawn kills, if he gets hit He Fountain Chugs. (This was Within Vals Classic Duel Server) All in All, he randomed roughly 60 or so times, With around 50-55 of those being spawn kills.
He is NOT what the Community is to be. Randoming and Spawn killing in a CLASSIC duel server (Apparently he doesn't understand what that is despite Multiple explanations). Even another player of the Server (Who was friend of CRUSHED) said ""Your the one being the dick. He asked for help, Not Randoming and spawn killing.""
Worse over all this, He acted as though it was my fault for asking for help. As though He had no choice in it and that No matter the 50-55 Randoms he did, it wasn't his fault for Randoming, NO. It was MY fault. All because i asked for help, and then requested him to stop spawn killing and randoming a near Countless amount of times, and then he expected me to have to change MY class and how I want to play, so HE doesn't Random or Spawn kill ME.
Tell me how much sense this makes like it sounds to me
A Player asks you for help, So what do you do?
Spawn Kill him 50+ Times, literally just allowing enough time to spawn and then killing him, and doing this Over Four Dozen Times. AND then, You blame HIM for causing all of this, When he has asked you to stop. Since the Second or Third Random/Spawn Kill. And your at 50+ Spawn Kills at this point. NO, its HIS fault for not changing HIS class because HE asked for you to stop, but didn't change his class, its HIS fault.
Victim Blaming in 101. Its THEIR fault for requesting help, Requesting for you to stop, and its THEIR fault because they didn't have you stop.~~

My main remaining concern though is that the dinosaurs have some level of physicality in their interactions with characters. The original did this great, through limited use of CGI and lots of practical effects. The up close interactions the characters had with the raptors (and other dinosaurs) were so believable. The focus in the trailers on the larger dinosaurs makes me very concerned about this."

Here's a cool dumb story. I was doing a Viking combat display for the National Maritime Museum in Sydney. Threw my shield at my opponent, who responded by reaching out and hitting my now exposed, unarmoured hand, and severed my left index finger. I was then taken into a nearby corporate lobby where I bled copiously over expensive Italian leather couches, then on to RPA hospital where I was the first sword related injury in over 100 years. Only part of the incident I remember is looking at where my finger was now hanging by a single tendon, seeing the bone and spurting blood, and saying,

""That'll need stitches"".

My next clear memory is of sitting in the A+E waiting room oh the RPA with a bunch of other fully armed and armoured Vikings. Finger was surgically reattached and I retain about 90% functionality, but have a cool scar and a unique story."

cqugfiz&DentalSchool&OpticalReality&"I have seen a lot of these ""chance me"" posts on SDN and I really don't think anyone can offer a definitive answer either way.  That being said, I have been where you are and have benefitted a great deal from the advice and perspectives of others who were there before me.  So based on my experience applying, doing a lot of reading about applying, and speaking with others, a few points come to mind for you.  

Firstly, your experience is great.  A lot of applicants focus on research or clinical experience and you have both.  It sounds like you have this aspect of your application down.  You will have great stories for your app essays and be able to earnestly describe your interest in dentistry to interviewers.

Secondly, your GPA isn't amazing, but it also isn't bad.  It certainly won't disqualify you, given your experience.  I have heard anecdotally that schools prioritize GPA above experience.  Perhaps a great GPA can even outweigh a lack of experience because it shows that you can handle the academic rigor of dental school.  

Which, brings me to my last point: On the other hand, since your GPA is not amazing, you need to show that you have mastered the basic science curriculum that is the foundation of what you will learn in dental school.  Unfortunately, your only option (other than taking more classes and raising your GPA) is to dominate the DAT.  

Your DAT score needs to improve.  

Some schools have a cutoff where they will not accept an applicant with scored in any section under 17.  Your chances are not great right now.  You might get interviews, you may even get in, but the standards for admission to dental school are against you. 

But that's okay!!!  Because you can improve your chances. So don't rule yourself out, just do some serious soul searching, dig deep down and find the will to come back and dominate the DAT.  The fact that you rushed through the last section is indicative to me that you weren't prepared.  Ask yourself what this path and career means to you and if it means enough, then use your willpower to sacrifice and study hard.  

Make a plan.  Remove all distractions and obligations. Take 6 weeks off and study every single day.  Grab some exercise and see a friend or SO now and again, but make it your life's mission to succeed on the DAT.  

I believe that you want to become a dentist.  I believe that you will make the choices you need to get there.  I believe in you. 

Now go get it!!! :)"

cqugfj4&linuxadmin&dicey&GPG lets you encrypt a file to multiple recipients. It's a single file, but it's implemented as a random bit stream which is used to encrypt the contents, and the bit stream is then encrypted with each recipient's public key and stored in the file. So you have one copy of the cyphertext and N copies of the decryption key that is encrypted with N different public keys, all in the same file.

There are a lot of great games on there that are more than worth their price, I think to simply blame the developers is to ignore the larger issues that are going on here. Ouya has had its back against the wall from day one, it was thrown under the bus by the gaming press, and it lacked the capital backing that has allowed other more established companies to enter the marketplace. 

Blaming the developers for the ouya failing is like blaming students for a school closing. There might be a legitimate argument, but you are overlooking an important point. "

My PvP Final Round one has current roll of Ambush/Rodeo/Perfect Balance/Final Round. I don't know if Perfect Balance and Rodeo effectively ""stack"" but if it does, holy shit this will be like Praedyth's Revenge and have no kickback.

cqugfon&funny&Mr_Biophile&"I was just joking because it's a common theme on reddit so I wanted to try on the STEM junkie persona. I actually have huge respect for what you do and thank you for what you're able to do for those people in your care; some situations would require much more self-discipline than I have myself.

I am a Molecular Biology and Applied Maths double major, so I definitely am part of the STEM crowd, but I don't actually feel the way I was impersonating. The only opinion I have that is slightly STEM-circlejerky is that psychology isn't a science in the same way that physics or biology is. I personally admit that biology isn't as hardcore as physics, so it just kinda rubs me the wrong way when psych majors want to consider themselves hard scientists, yet when you compare the courses of study, psych is simply not as rigorous.

Yeah, that's probably a bigoted view I'm guilty of holding, but I'm proud of the work I put into my degrees and when someone suggests that they are my equal when they haven't put in as much work as I have, I get worked up.

Anyways, I hope my comments didn't bother you too much because they weren't  sincere! Keep fighting the good fight for those in your care, I'm sure you're a very positive influence in their lives!"

The document states that the number of inmates claiming they were sexually assaulted rose from ~6,000 (2005) to ~9,000 (2011). However, the report also states that the confirmed/verified assaults have stayed stable over the years (from 885 to 902). 

Even if we assume that all alleged sexual assaults did indeed occur, the Daily Mail's figures are ~20 times over the official ones."

cqugfoz&AskHistorians&riot-sugar&"I agree with this. I also think a lot of the perceived ""grittyness"" or mature situations from anime comes from the Western notion that most animated series are for kids. When in reality, plenty of anime is made for an adult audience (like NGE, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, etc.). This idea has somewhat changed over time, but in general anime and animated series in the West are viewed as for children, despite their target audiences. NGE in America was originally aired on a block made for kids, but was pulled before the third episode. "

cqugftc&hometheater&agray20938&"A couple other things you could consider: You can paint the cable hider to match the wall, which might help to hide it even more. You could also pick up a couple more for the rear speakers, and paint them as well. In addition, the Fluance front speakers are rear-ported, so you'll benefit by pulling them away from the wall about a foot, if you can manage it.

THX recommends 80hz crossover, so I use that. Depending on how low your speakers get, you might want to adjust it beyond that. With small front speakers and small rear speakers, 90hz sounds about right.

Set your sub to 0, and adjust it if something ever seems off."

cqugftw&TwoXChromosomes&Deep_freeze202&"I only point out that this is america because what works in another country may not necessarily work here, not cause murica. If family leave affects both genders and men have it worse how can you use it as an example of female oppression?
 My point is that rape isn't a gender issue and it isn't oppression either.
 I've never had to see a gynecologist so I can't speak on how easy it is to get an appointment but I can't agine it being any more difficult than scheduling any other Dr appointment.
 Roe vs wade may get challenges but its still the law of the land, healthcare in general is expensive so I don't see how that is oppression either. As far as birth control goes there's plenty of inexpensive options and really no excuse since the primary purpose of vaginal intercourse is reproduction, people who are unwilling or unable to raise a child should practice abstinence rather than expecting the rest of society to pay for their birth control so they can have all the sex they like without consequence. If you're having sex you take on the possibility of a pregnancy it's not an accident I don't understand why people want to relieve themselves of responsibility for their actions.

Maybe I'm not recalling correctly on the domestic violence thing I do recall clearly seeing that women are the purpotratirs more often than men and they also tend to use weapons like knives, so I'd say men get hurt worse than women do.

Well women are generally way more emotional than men are so PMS or not you never know how much of what they're saying is truth and how much is exaggeration and drama.

Mansplain is a word made up to silence opposing views when men try to have a say in gender discussions, within the feminist movement men are constantly marginalized and dismissed, because equality. I'm coming into a female dominated apace to offer a different point of view. See you can class men dismiss women because of their gender but that is bullshit women get just as much respect as men do bases on what they're saying. If a woman is spouting crap that is incorrect or irrational then of course shell be dismissed the same as any man doing the same.

I was talking historically in response to the notion that women couldn't so things men could, it worked both ways and it wasn't just women who were forced into certain roles but that never gets brought up because if it was the case for men and women then you can't use it as proof of women being oppressed in the past. If histrionic has gendered connotations I'm not aware of it.

What I've learned from your post - women are somehow oppressed in the first world yet you can't give a single example of it, what you have given is issues that both men and women deal with being appropriated as affecting women only or  affecting women worse and complaining because society is supporting women with free/cheap birth control and healthcare."

If the fetus has a right to life, then you shouldn't kill it. It's not fair to kill the fetus for it's rapist scumbag father.

If the fetus *doesn't* have a right to life then getting an abortion is fine in any case, rape or no rape.

If you say only women who were raped can get abortions, then you're basically just punishing the women who had sex willingly because ... sex is bad and/or only for married couples?"

cqugfu0&AsianBeauty&Eletas&"I'll add some quick recommendations so I can send you into the world of snails:

* Mizon All In One Snail Repair Cream - *light moisturizer, not enough as a standalone cream*
* Mizon All in One Black Snail Repair Cream - *slightly more moisturizing than the Mizon All In One Cream, but still not enough*
* COSRX Snail Essence - *Great essence to check out, 96% snail mucin filtrate*
* COSRX Snail Cream - *~~Higher snail mucus percentage than Mizon's cream,~~ non-irritating for sensitive skin, overall better*

-- Overall, I think the COSRX Snail Cream would be a great place to start and would probably help the most with hyperpigmentation out of all the other snail creams out there. As for dull skin, I would try out some sort of exfoliation such as Mizon 8% AHA Serum, COSRX AHA Whitehead Power Liquid or Cure Aqua Gel. Vitamin C serums would probably also help with both hyperpigmentation and dull skin so that's definitely worth a look over."

Some people might claim that they're all for acceptance of sexual orientations but when it comes down to it, they really can't let go of their old traditions.

It's obviously alot better and alot safer to come out of your closet here in Singapore but you can still feel the judgement.

cqugfzg&beyondthebump&KtWallops&As someone who was induced at 36 weeks w/ my first child for pre-e, I would recommend avoiding induction unless absolutely medically necessary. Measuring/estimating baby size is very subjective and often very wrong. They estimated my son to be 1lb larger. My body wasn't ready to labor and the induction was taxing and unnatural, although completely medically necessary. My second birth my labor started naturally. Completely different experience, much better. Being 1 week overdue I had to advocate for myself to avoid induction/unnecessary intervention. Ended up having a vbac with #2 and highly doubt it would have happened had I been induced. Good luck!! You are your own best advocate for the birth you desire.

cqugfzu&baseball&Empire48&"Ok, but in a scenario between two rebuilding franchises why don't we see a trade like this happen?  For example, the Cubs currently have ~3 SS in their system (Castro, Russell, and Baez).  The general consensus is that Baez will play 2B and Castro will eventually be traded so Russell can play SS.

However, the team doesn't have many pitching prospects so why not trade Baez for a top pitching prospect?  If anything, Baez has lost value since last year due to his extreme struggles at the MLB level (very high strikeout rate).  Trading him while he is still a prospect keeps his high value at the time and brings back another relevant future piece in return."

cqugfzy&leafs&EnergyDrinkerr&At the start of the year, Sparks was the defacto AHL starter going into the season. He lost his job to a younger, more talented goalie in Bibeau, who had just come off a MONSTER Memorial cup run. He was the best player on his team (which included 50g man, Mantha) by a mile.

cqugg0l&XWingTMG&Ianchuck&Both are great lists and its very hard to say which is better. One thing to consider that I think many don't is the fatigue you face the longer a tournament goes on. Regionals will be 75 minute rounds and you will likely be playing 4-5 before they break to top 8. That's 5 to 6.25 hours of play at minimum if you don't drop. So anything that reduces the amount of mental exertion helps. The bbbb* lists are already a great choice in this respect but going the ac route is even easier still (1 less ship, all the same dial, less thought on actions/tokens).

cqugg10&Winnipeg&adrenaline_X&"But Pitt becoming famous is due to him having great looks. If he was ugly, then he would have been passed over for many of the roles he landed. Being pretty is a large reason actors land roles.   If they are horrible actors they are still going land jobs but not as many. Brad Pitt partially became famous for his role in legends of the fall and all the girls absolutely dawned over him and he landed a lot of roles because of women's reaction to him.

The Sex trade has been around longer the Christians have believed Jesus and the bible. This not going to change males are biologically programmed, with some exceptions, to be physically attracted to women at a very animalistic nature. Society as a whole has tried to change this few 100s of years but you can't get around it. Women wearing low tops, short short, yoga pants etc are playing on this primal male Sex drive. They are using it to their advantage to get ahead or gain something. Men use their own privledges to get ahead.   If some give a waitress a bigger tip based on their look that their issue.

Do I judge people? Ofcourse I do, but I realize that I'm judging someone and try to change my perception or reaction. You nor I have any right to complain or bitch about how someone else lives their lives. And if u do feel you have the right to do this then you should be okay when some interrupt your life or ability to make a living based solely based on their judgment of you.

Women are playing a game with men and it's one they choose to play by accepting these roles or jobs or lifestyle. You can disagree with this choices and live your life differently but by now means are you living a more worthy, or more important life then them. "

cqugg2v&ffxiv&cremedelapoop&"Choose a crafting class that can support the Disciples of War or Disciples of Magic classes that you're leveling. If you're leveling a tank or post-level 25 dragoon, an Armorer makes most of your armor. If bard, monk, or ninja, leatherworker for the armor. If a caster, weaver. The ""problem"" with this advice, however, is that your crafter will have to be almost the same level as your combat class to make level appropriate armor. Without the list of useful crafting skills listed by /u/Erik_Highwind it may be hard to HQ the gear

Also consider which classes make your weapons. Carpenter for dragoon, bard and whitemage; blacksmith for tank and ninja weapons, plus some monk and dragoon ones; goldsmith for blackmage weapons (and almost all accessories beyond lvl 29); leatherworker for some monk weapons; alchemist for some whitemage weapons and summoner, scholar books. I may have missed a few, you could browse the recipe book on ffxivcrafting.com to understand what each class makes.

Note that the above advice is not necessary for people who are leveling their first combat class. You get some gear every five levels. But it's nice, especially if you can make high quality gear. Firstly, HQ gear has slightly higher stats. Secondly, it spiritbonds faster. When gear is 100% spiritbonded, you can convert it into materia, which is bought and sold actively on the market board, occasionally for ridiculous prices. I'd hazard a guess that once you begin converting gear from the lvl 30-45 range, you'll start getting the occasional gem that sells well. 

You could also choose to level a class that gets most support from the gatherer class you're leveling. Miners provide most of the materials for armorers, blacksmiths and gold smiths, while botanists supply carpenters, alchemists, culinarians, weavers. A fisher is more fun for world exploration than supplying mats. When I was leveling crafters and had to buy materials from the market board, I hated it when I was forced to buy overpriced things, or stacks of 99. This is where self sufficiency in material gathering is a plus. 

The most significant boost to crafting xp comes from tradecraft courier leves, where you usually pick up the leve in a hub city, then turn in the crafted item in another area. If you HQ the item you get double the xp. I believe you'll need to do about 10 of these to advance five levels, so stock up on material accordingly. "

You are actually fine. With your own knee, it's a thousand times easier to have normal gait. The most important things to do is keep your muscles strong, and STRETCH. If your residuum's hamstrings start getting contractures your gait will look like crap. Next, would be comfort of your socket and suspension. If it hurts to walk and you're always trying to avoid a certain area, it won't look normal. It also will look terrible if you keep slipping out the socket. The rest can be adjustable by a good prosthetist, and can be trained quite easily.

TL/DR; I thought you said AK; with your own knee, it's very easy to walk normally with no one ever knowing."

And now, if I rotate the camera away from the front, my head will lift up like I'm E.T. and grow 3 feet up in the air. It even does this to an extent in cars as well. By far the most annoying part to first person to me.

cqugg6a&ffxiv&AerinRavage&"Is there a way to use my 1.0 install media to switch to PC before Heavensward?

A couple years ago, I bought the 1.0 CE with hopes of playing on the PC I had at the time. However, since the PC wasn't mine, I found myself returning it before I installed. Fast-forward to ARR Beta 3, where I grabbed a PS3 CE copy and finally made it to Eorzea. Shortly after sorting out the PS3 install, I registered the 1.0 codes for all my bonus goodies.

I'm on PS4 now but want to go PC before 3.0. If I get a suitable gaming rig, is there a way to get ARR on it without extra expense? I'll be buying the 3.0 CE soon and don't want to double-buy ARR if I don't have to.

Searching here and on Google led to answers about PC to console switches, and Steam store stuff, but nothing like this (I think).

cqugg7g&runescape&HashTagDeeperino&"OSRS from what I hear is pretty god awful. They have a track record of being a bunch of childish pricks, there was an instance of a charity event being flooded with hate from OSRS in chat. That was a livesteam though, Twitch is kind of a cesspool anyway so that's a low blow on them though, I guess?

The PK community is mostly where OSRS went though, and we've seen how aggressive people can get over PVP. 

Anyway, RS3's community's still pretty shitty too but that's mostly shown out of at least a genuine concern. The most annoying thing I see about the community is their stupidity regarding MTX. Being against MTX is totally fine but some people just are dense as shit and refuse to accept being even slightly wrong, then you've just got people who are way too zealous and refuse to want to work with Jagex and instead go for a very ""NO MTX WHAT SO EVER GET RID OF IT NOWWWWWWW"" sort of approach. 

But even those people, they're not assholes really, even the people who really aren't level headed and really have no idea what they're talking about (which is by no means all of them) are really just looking out for what they believe is best for the game anyway. . . 

So compare that to what I've said about OSRS . . . 

Obviously RS3' got my vote. 

_____

Being a skiller on RS3? Easier or harder . . . Mm. I guess harder, depends? OSRS doesn't have dungeoneering, dungeoneering requires you to either pay people to let you leech or for you to participate in combat so if we consider that? I guess RS3's way harder, especially with 120 dungeoneering.

Overall I tend to think of, content wise anyway, OSRS v. RS3 like this, RS3 intends to add more and more updates, OSRS will add very sparse, polled updates. RS3 is already years ahead of OSRS content by it's very nature. . . RS3's going to not necessarily be harder or easier as much as it will be more expansive.

We've got [runespan](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Runespan) for runecrafting and you can make some good money on [vis wax](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Vis_wax) so I guess maybe it'd be easier to do it on RS3? The main thing I'm really not sure about is prices for OSRS, this is a huge deal for buyable skills and largely will dictate just how hard things are. Tl;dr not really sure but I'd suggest RS3 anyway.

cqugg7l&serialpodcast&csom_1991&"I tried to withhold my judgment until the end.  I listened to the whole podcast over the Christmas break with SO and we had been told to listen to it by a friend who was hooked while it was still ongoing.  That friend laid out the evidence of a false conviction and was in the innocent camp when they recommended so I had that in the back of my mind - the whole - there is this serial killer that is the one that actually did it story.

By the end, I was scratching my head.  I thought there was some huge exculpatory piece of evidence coming and I never heard it.  From how SK and Rabia described the prosecution and CG, I expected something much, much more than what was presented. Still, I was pretty sure he was actually guilty but the case was weak.  I was particularly interested in the cell data as I worked in RF and cell planning for many years.  After looking at the actual maps and reading the actual testimony, it is clear that the prosecution did not claim what Serial or the innocent camp said that they claims (being consistent with is not saying is it 100% proof the call was from LP).  Once I read the testimony, I concluded that everything AW testified to was correct.

After reading over the actual transcripts, I am firmly in the guilty camp.  I don't think it was a moment of passion, I think it was premeditated murder over Adnan's pride being hurt.  I think he is a complete liar and lacks and remorse for the crime so he deserves to spend the rest of his life in jail.  I actually feel bad for the people in the innocent camp at this point as they are blind to the manipulation.  I can see the 'fresh from listening' crew still thinking innocent (or not enough to convict), but it is hard to fathom how anyone that has read the transcripts or read this sub for month or longer could still think that."

cqugg82&canada&Agent47pureaidsrun&"I'm not sure what to do this election. I can't continue to reward the PC's for their corrupt mismanagement of the province. I've never broken ranks before, I've never had to, after Getty's mess, we had Klein, who was willing to do what needed to be done and weather the outrage. 
But we don't have another Klein right now, just people who put ambition over responsibility. 

I don't actually want any other party in power, but the PC's have to remember to represent us, not themselves. They're completely off the rails and need to be scared back on track. In Alberta, and in Ottawa too. 

The WR would just be co-opted and ultimately strengthen the PC's, the Alberta party might as well not exist as it gets no traction in the shadow of the pc/wr's (too bad, because they're actually fairly reasonable), I'd wipe my ass with a ballot before I'd ever vote for the thieving Liberals, so that leaves me with the NDP, which makes me nervous, they have a history of ravaging provinces and are generally ridiculous. 

But we DO need to play chicken with the PC's or they will never change. 

This is a situation of driving home the point that a home needs to be renovated by tossing a moltov in the living room. 

But it does need to happen. 

I don't trust the NDP at all, but it's feeling like they're the only viable party to send a real message to the PC's. "

I'm not asking for them to drop everything and help me immediately, I just want a little more transparency.  

Another thing is that they ripped open the ceiling to get to the pipes, so if those pipes decide to burst on us again and neither me nor my roommate are home we don't have any ""wall"" to at least catch some of that water.  I mean, maybe it's not as dire as a heating situation but it's also not simply cosmetics either.

He hated the ending right?  Generally when something has a really bad ending, you give it a score lower than you usually give it (had it ended better).

Even after the show ended poorly, he was considering giving it an 8.

Yes I guess you can be distracted about fancy art and what not. But the last thing that sticks in your mind is the ending. To give something an 8 and then have a completely thought process that manages to bring down your score in half is really odd, *especially* after the poor ending. 

It makes me think that he was likely over analyzing/nitpicking.

I know not everyone uses the MAL scale, but 4 is most obviously a bad score (on a scale of 10)."

cquggah&Baking&boo_hiss&Try a different kind of buttercream from what you're used to, say French/Swiss/Italian/German rather than simple American buttercream. There's also ermine frosting, 7 minute frosting, whipped cream frosting (less stable unless you pick a recipe that uses gelatin or something), whipped ganache, meringue, or [marshmallow frosting](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/super-easy-marshmallow-icing-recipe).

Also, in America we enjoy the greatest freedom of speech in the world, as protected by our constitution. A part of the law that I spent weeks on in my Con Law class. I feel confident that at least in this country free speech is safe, There are originations, like the ACLU, committed to upholding it. I don't think either the ACLU or my extremely conservative Con Law teacher would say the PoE incident has anything, whatsoever to do with free speech. In fact the only one telling someone thay can't say something is you. I say, you can say whatever you want. You are the one saying you can't say what you think, because language? It is a bizarre and indefensible understanding of free speech.

And since I just went appeal to authority that was at the 3rd best law school in California. "

cquggbc&Entrepreneur&Digisect&"Just scrolled through this quickly but having worked for a big 4 accounting firm in this capacity, it looks like the standard  sort of template that would be sent off to a potential acquisition but obviously tailored after somewhat more to their specific business.

The real trick is knowing what to make of all the info received I.e. how to analyze and what it means. It's not really that hard actually, just can be a lot of material to figure out.

The most important part of the DD process,  and this is just my opinion, will be the phase after these intial questions,  the follow up questions.  Baaically after finding out some things,  knowing what to ask next to probe further is crucial, to determine if and how much risk there really is.

Finally, I should probably say from experience depending on the size of the transaction a lot of sellers will baulk at such a rigorous list of questions as above.  Which you cant really blame them if for example its a $10k deal, the time spent to get that all together wouldn't be worth it.

Anyone interested in some more basic DD on websites ans startups to see some actual examples, you can see at a site of mine www.digisect.com. I haven't posted in a long time as I've been too busy but some of the posts are DD reports on actual websites that have been for sale and startup investments. "

It really is a game changer.  Want an explosive laser that doesn't suck like the one from Claptastic Voyage? Just go from a TORGUE weapon to a laser, and voìla! 

If you're a fan of Hyperion gear (I am, but not ""Old"" Hyperion), ""Company Man"" is outstanding. 

""Money is Power"" only works until you spend it (or die), so it helps to have ammo regen COMs (or Moxxtails) and skills like ""Jack's Cache"" from the left tree to save your money. 

I really want an Omni-Cannon to see how it works with ""Compound Interest"", a decked-out ""Company Man"", and ""Sponsored By..."" with a Maliwan weapon. I know the latter will kick ass, because I have one on my cryo/sniper Aurelia build (not much of a choice there), which makes me automatically add Cryo effects AND another element from her left capstone. TVHM Eternals and Guardians get wrecked in one to two critical hits, respectively. If I have a good stack of ""I Never Miss"", the carnage extends to everyone.

cquggd0&pathofexile&arthordark&"It sort of like they rolled in Conc and AoE into the gem. Before it was 75% base at lvl 20 + 57% inc. physical dmg. If you ignore the 57% (I use a windripper, so phy dmg doesn't matter to me) then you're doing 45.3% MORE dmg (109/75) compared to before. The base area of the skill also appears to be larger than current lvl 1 RoA on live servers. There's also some changes to Inc. AoE (+20% inc at lvl 1) gem, and to Conc Eff gem (40% more dmg, 25% LESS aoe) These things combined, I'd say it's a very nice buff.

Also forgot to add, they changed the quality bonus from 0.5 attack speed to 1% area damage."

cquggfo&changemyview&beaperson&"I'm saying that racism isn't a function of police unions, and it seems unlikely that if they went away cops would just wholesale stop killing black people. For example, Robert Bates was a reserve sheriff deputy in Oklahoma who shot Eric Harris in the back. Bates wasn't a member of the union, he was a volunteer and a donor to the department.

The issue also isn't cops not getting fired, it's a pervasive attitude within the criminal justice system. Prosecutors do not need the union's permission to investigate criminal complaints against police. The failed indictments in New York and Ferguson last fall had nothing to do with unions. Police abuse of power is criminal, they should be going to jail not getting fired."

cquggfw&firstworldanarchists&Godzilla2y&"Oh man. I worked at a place over the summer that was generally *hell*. In the almost 90 days that I worked there, 18 people were fired or quit, including the one guy that got thrown in jail. some of them didn't work there for longer than a week. the guy that was hired the day before me didn't last beyond lunch break.

This was for a variety of reasons: Scheduling was always a bit fucky; we were almost always behind schedule. A couple of times my friend and I stayed there working until 8 PM (after starting at 6 AM and supposing to get out at 3 PM) just so we didn't fall ABSOLUTELY, COMPLETELY behind (which really just meant our manager would have been breathing down our neck until things got fixed and threats of firing us). Things broke all the time, the shop was always 50% new guys which meant hardly anyone knew what was going on, drama all the time, the company was undergoing acquisition from a larger corporation, the actual work was demanding physical labor...

But the general manager brought donuts in for us nearly every time we had to work on Saturday. We worked a lot of Saturdays. He even brought in a bunch of food and grilled lunch for us one day. He was a great guy, he was just a pretty bad manager. But the donuts made those Saturdays a little less shitty."

cquggh8&leagueoflegends&YoloNomo&"Everytime he plays Bjergsen? In Bjergsen's first NA LCS finals, he destroyed Bjergsen. Hai died like three times total in that final. The second finals, Bjersen did better overall but Hai did great with his Zed too. In regular series, he has always done just fine against Bjergsen except in this split where Bjergsen was clearly better because well he is a better player but he also got way more resources in mid than Hai did.

Dade season 4? Hai never died 1v1 but yes Dade won that matchup but thats like saying Bjergsen got destroyed by POE so he sucks. It happens. As for Xpeke in S3, again Hai did just fine in lane but Xpeke took over late game with his Kassadin. As Hai admitted, C9 made a huge mistake because they thought they could counter Kassadin despite it being a super strong champion that everyone was banning. That said, in that series, Hai was actually the one that mechanically outplayed Xpeke and got a 1v1 kill with his Fizz.

Hai is not weak mechanically, its how C9 plays. They just dont pressure mid and prefers to focus elsewhere because Hai used to be self sufficient. He would compensate for it by putting pressure all around the map at the expense of his lane. But now with most teams getting pretty good at vision game Hai cannot roam as effectively anymore, and with his team not adapting to pressure more in mid lane relative to how much pressure his opponents are getting, Hai has essentially been a sitting duck this split.

Anyways, just because some reddit guys like you says Hai sucks doesnt make it so. I would trust what pros like Shiphtur, Voyboy, and even Bjergsen says about Hai."

cqugghw&ADHD&darkside619&"Yea, I used to be at UCSD and they had free healthcare for students, but I didn't realize I had ADHD at the time.  I flunked out so any treatment they could have provided can no longer do me any good.  It's okay though, I'm working my way to transfer to another university.  

When I first got kicked out I was bitter at UCSD, feeling like they could have been more understanding and all that, but I've since gotten over those feelings. I realize that as administrators they just thought that I wasn't taking school seriously; it's not like they were out to get me for no reason.  

Plus, I think it doesn't matter what university or college a person attends as long as they make the most of their experience there.  Being a 4.0 student at a lesser known university is better than being a 2.0 student at UCSD or some other prestigious university like Harvard; at least in my opinion.  Others might disagree and think that only the name of the school matters. 

 For my major especially I don't think it matters since I'm doing computer science, and it's one of those fields where if you can prove that you know what you're doing, employers will hire you.  It's more of a fair profession in that sense."

cquggi1&vegan&Volundarkvioa&"Oh, you'll face humiliation and taunting for being vegan, but believe me it isn't quite the same as being gay. The chances of your family disowning you for being a vegan is incredibly less likely than if you were gay. Being gay also isn't a choice. Being vegan is. Which means that I don't believe it's fair to give the comparison to coming out of the closet.



If you feel bad about the meat industry, then go vegan. Like I said, you *will* face criticism, humiliation, taunting, and so forth. But every social cause has had that issue. Women could've sat down and shut up whilst men ran the world, but feminism would never have gotten its reach. Women would've been stuck in the household unlikely to ever get a job beyond possibly that of a secretary position.



~~Black Americans could've kept their lips shut and sat at the back of the bus, but they would've continued to be put down if they didn't speak up.~~



If you believe in something, truly believe in it, you need to stand up and fight for it. You don't need to tell everyone you're vegan at every possible interaction (I only bring it up when it's relevant), but to say you hate the system but not to fight against it is both hypocritical and cowardly.



And yeah, they're curious because it seems unusual. You're so used to eating meat. Why stop eating it and why now of all times? You've got to talk to them about it first to see if they'll be supportive or not. If they're not, then you can always go vegan or vegetarian when you have control over your own life. But they may actually be supportive of your decision if you talk to them about it."

cquggi7&BabyBumps&tricyclist&"I think the idea you have is a good one. I told my mom when I went into labor last time. She spontaneously called in for work that day (It was 5 am at the time) and sat in the parking lot of the birth center all day until 2pm when the boy was born. And of course she told me this, so it was in the back of my mind the entire time. (She wanted to come in and wait in the waiting room. No? I had no idea what was going to happen. Those sound proof doors are good but...things like the shower and stuff are on the other side. All I need would be for her to see me, run down the hall and engage.)

In addition, we had a video chat with my mother in law with this baby at the gender reveal baby shower, and she posted some stupid picture she found, on facebook for all her friends to see, before I even got home from the shower (not a picture of our cake or anything, since there weren't any pictures yet...). I looked at the time stamp, did the math and figured out she had done it immediately. I confronted her about it, she deleted it, and still didn't re-share the picture that I had posted. Damage was done anyway.

Yeah, neither of them are knowing we're in labor until the baby is born, and they are not getting pictures until I post them myself. Remember, if they do it once, they'll probably do it again."

""How long are you supposed to wait until you should get tested I believe it's two weeks, but I'm nervous wondering if that's too early?""
First off let's address this, there a lot of different types of HIV tests. The first which detects HIV the earliest post exposure is an HIV RNA test. This test has a high false readings rates which is why its seldomly ever used. The second earliest is a 4th generation HIV test which are very accurate now and have around a 90% success rate at 2 weeks post exposure(I recommend this test to ease your mind due to its early test time and high success rate.) The most common are 3rd generation HIV tests which are nearly 100% accurate at 6 weeks post exposure. None of these numbers are at 100% for 2 reasons, one to address possible failures in the test itself and two to address people who seroconvert later than others. Everyone who isn't heavily immuno-compromised will be detectable at 8 weeks on a third generation test, but I still follow CDC recommendations of follow up testing at 3 months to further confirm earlier tests. Note that this follow up test does not mean you will be HIV positive at 3 months you most surely will not as this is just a safety measure to get rid of those pesky .0000001% chances of test failures(which are mainly just statistical backlash anyways.)
TL;DR on testing etiquette: RNA test don't do it, 2nd generation do it at 2week post exposure, 3rd generation test at 6 weeks and always test again at 3 months.
http://www.rnceus.com/fl2hiv/test2.html
source for information above and keep in mind the gaps in stats are to incorporate people who have compromised immune systems such as people on chemo, late stages of cancer, and heavy drug users. The windows of testing are large to make sure that no one slips by due to any matter as it would be negligent to otherwise considering the severity of HIV.

Next on the list the risk:
The average per risk of condomless sex from topping a male who is infected with HIV is .03%. Yes it really is that low, HIV's ability to infect is very low as it infects a very specific and hard to find cell that it has to just bump into aswell as considering that HIV is extremely fragile. The virus dies near instantly upon exposure to oxygen and the viral amount needed to infect is roughly 2 million units of HIV(to put this into perspective the highest HIV amount the largest mosquito can carry from feeding off an AIDS infected patient is roughly 1,000 units which is near a full ounce of HIV infected blood from the highest concentration naturally possible. You can begin to see why HIV has a low infection rate and this isn't even taking into consideration the effect that the mucous membrane plays in your urethra in preventing HIV from passing into your body.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS
I feel like I have rambled enough.
You chances of contracting HIV are very low just test at the above recommendations and test again at 3 months for guidelines sake and in the future take care of yourself, know the risks, be careful, and remember that sex is only a small part of your life that could ruin the rest of it."

-Damage Control/Engineering

I've also seen some variety of loadmaster position, but I'm not sure what that looks like in combat.

Regarding the all-or-nothing Firespray situation, who says everything is handled by the pilot? Why can't more than one person help? Remember that this is a narrative game that easily handles semi-flexible time flow, so you don't need to rigorously adhere to deckplans or other matters that are not outright stated. Even if you insist on one crewmember controlling everything, who's to say that the rest of the party can't be backseat drivers? They can make their rolls to come up with suggestions to manage the comms, angle shields, and use other systems, leaving to pilot to only have to input their requests and then focus on their own actions. The pilot should be literally limited to one maneuver and one action, but rather can only himself complete that many tasks; there's nothing saying he can't be doing other things in a round like inputing the actions of the rest of the party. If you still can't get it working, maybe it's time for a new ship so that everyone can participate.

Every single character should have a role to play and viable actions to perform in a physical conflict, and starship combat should be no different."

Ranger would be the better choice, I think, to level first. You get hella damage from their skills. Only downside is that you'd have to craft a bow for ranger equippable for most things til you have some stats to equip allclass bows. Eh, it doesn't really matter. You can easily craft a ロングボウ til you can use it with ranger. That'll last you a long, long while. Deadly Breeze is a strong potential for Ra/Br.

On the other hand, I like TV shows where each episode is a distinct adventure, like Star Trek.

cquggmb&asktrp&[deleted]&"Yes I know, but I have to ask, why do you think MWALT?

""TRP has resonated with a lot of guys. I don't advocate it as a cult, and I pick and choose what I find is true, false, or unproven (in my eyes).""

As I said before, I don't tend to read reasonable things like this here very often(maybe it's me).

""I advise you to look past the language of absolutes and see if there is any truth or useful information for your life. I found a lot of interesting stuff in the sidebar. ""

There are some truths and valuable nuggets of information in just about every group, but some groups are so shifty/seemingly unethical at large that you tend to stay away. For every guy like you seem to be, in this /r there are a whole bunch of guys who just flat out give the impression they have very little regard for women, and certainly don't see them as people to be treated with respect, ad the justification is that she secretly likes all that shit, cuz instincts and evo psyche.

I mean, read this from a recent thread: ""Women cock block out of instinct because they're jealous, petty creatures for the most part."" That, in essence is why people hate RP so much. Most people(including myself) would still have major issues with what RP teaches, but wouldn't hate it quite so much if so many of it's members weren't so damn mean-spirited and opportunistic.

""I think part of it is that a lot of men refuse to believe the stove is hot and have to be burned a few times for the idea to stick. Maybe you've just had good relationships that have never ended badly for you.""

Oh buddy let me tell ya, I have. And you and I both know how utterly horrible it can be, especially if you were in love at the time. I get how bad things can get, but I still recognize that it's an issue with either myself, or the specific women I was involved with. No matter how tempting it might be when I feel bitter to make general declarations about the supposed nature of women, I couldn't do that and still be logical.

Besides, this last paragraph could as easily be used by women(and has), to make general claims about men and how they're this way and that, because the particular woman just had issues with particular men. 

I don't see how either case makes sense.

Picrd is a key character, fitting into the archetypal role of the wise old man.  (If you don't know about archetypes, its interesting.  I suggest at least a glance at Jungian archetypes)

In your dream, you start in a cave, in the dark, captured by ogres who represent violence, barbarism.  You had given in to fate.  But it seemed like Picard, representing leadership and strength, gave you hope.  He was human, like you.  Your hope turned to disgust when he proposed intimacy.

What other associations do you have with Picard?  Think about your outer world as well.  Like the people you know or places you've been.  Anything that comes to you when you think about Picard (or even star trek since they are directly related)

cquggnt&thewitcher3&dfrazier81&"The Witcher series is a very very lore based game.   The Witcher 3 is going to have plenty of cutscenes and a ton of dialogue/choices to make.    So the Witcher 2 didnt even come close to 80 or even 10% of just cutscenes.   I suppose if you rushed through it and did nothing but main story quests you would tend to spend more time in them or if you consider dialog cutscenes?   If anything I would bet Witcher 3 is going to have way more cutscenes than previous titles.  However in a 50hr straight playthrough its probably still only a few hours at most total. 

Just trying to be honest and say it doesn't sound like your type of game.  Chances are it will win several GOTY awards especially in the RPG categories.   So its going to be an amazing game but that doesn't have to mean its your type of game.  "

cquggo4&golf&GradientRecall&"I've seen this question a few times, but the short answer is yes.  

Long answer: Its multifactorial, but includes the most important difference, course management.  Also, many people think they're hitting really well on the range because they only pay attention to distance and trajectory, make sure you're picking targets for every shot at the range, keeping in mind your distances on the course will vary.  Almost no lies are truly flat on the course, and of course don't forget about rough and hazards. Certainly not least, is short game/approach.  Practice chipping and putting as much, if not more than everything else.  One last thing I see a lot is people rushing their shots, forgetting about grip, setup, and tempo."

That being said, if that's the route we're going to imitate, I'd prefer to just do it for real then. Make an actual non-profit IT licensing body in each state, or nationally, and have them come up with standardized licenses. A better solution for employers so they know exactly what they're getting in a candidate, and a better solution for candidates so they're not paying a bunch of money to 2-3 certification companies every year.

I'll say that I was more aggressive than I'm used to when it comes to 'debate'. I felt like pressing my point forward, instead of just trying to contradict OP. It's a nice perspective to have, I think; to be paying Riot for what they've given you in experience and a quality time in League of Legends. It's one worth sharing, no?

So in the case that you wanted to kick me in the head because I sounded like (pardon the French) a twat, I don't necessarily blame you. I probably could've sounded a lot more disciplined. With that said, I don't necessarily want to. This is /r/leagueoflegends, after all; I'm not an alien and I don't want to present myself like one.

cquggru&steroids&nigh7owl&"My blood pressure is definitely higher than baseline... my pulse is always at least slightly elevated.  No doubt.  I've been taking siladenifil but am planning on getting tadalafil as it's got a longer half-life.

As far as whether it's worth it... I'd say it all depends on how cheap you can get it, and what your significant other/children situation is.  IIRC the TD trestolone base I used was priced at ~$80 for 3g TD solution, so $26/1g.  It'd be real nice to get some bulk powder, and make your own TD solution, if you can get it cheap enough... I talked a source down to $36 a gram shipped and that's nowhere near where it needs to be, to be cost-effective.  Compare that to the popular source of pre-prepared trestolone acetate in GSO, which I believe sells at $36/1g on sale, $50/1g not on sale.  GSO compared to TD comes out to be about even if you figure the TD solution is absorbing at 50% at best, which is the unsupported-in-data impression I have.

And I was always worried about not getting it on my girlfriend, and washing up before bed.  That was the worst part about the TD stuff for me, by far."

As for the motherboard and PSU, do you have recommendations available? For relatively small increases these are very much worth it to me.

CPU I'll probably stick with. Overall overclocking is probably not something I will deal with. GPU, unless there's an alternative in the same price range I'll probably stick with, and add a second in about a year, and be prepared to replace in 2-3 years.

If that's the true, all that perception is a waste...

The ingame description is ""Perception represents a character's senses as well as their instinctive ability to pick up on details. In interactions, it can be used to catch someone in a lie, to make an observant comment about their appearance, or to notice something happening in the background. In combat, it contributes to the Deflection and Reflex defenses and grants a bonus to Interrupt."" So it suggest it's responsible for spotting things...

Now as for the open shower, this is very similar to the baby sitter scenario. The only difference is it's the parents who take their kids to the showers to see the naked adults and there's no crime involved.

This is totally different when kids see other kids their age naked. Adults are authoritative figures to kids that's why I think they're more vulnerable."

But they spent a couple of months remodeling the area in order to turn that part of the store into the ""Market Café"". We also hired a few dozen waiters, waitresses, chefs, and managers in order to run the café and changing it back would mean letting those people go. Some shoppers are confused because they are accustomed to getting their food from one part of the store, e.g. Chinese express, Italian express, the deli, etc. and would go to the booths and enjoy their food there, however now they see that there is a restaurant and may be confused. These customers are more than welcome to enjoy their food inside the restaurant, but we are still in a sort of a transitioning stage as you can see by /u/ScottWalkerSucks post.

90/32 = 2.8 average per kicker.

So, they only happen, on average, less than once every 5 games per kicker.

To put this in perspective, out of the top 10 kickers last year, 32 FGs were made from 50+, for an average of only 3.2 made per kicker.  Still only once per five games.

And, as I mentioned elsewhere, the #1 kicker (Gostkowski) had only 1 from 50+ yards."

cquggyw&loseit&brawn_hilda&"Ok, so your Body Mass Index (BMI) is 31.6. Normal weight is 18-25, overweight is 25 to 30, and obese is over 30. 

I am going to assume for these calculations you are 25 years old. If you are lightly active around the house all day, then you burn about 2200 calories per day. If you limit those calories to 1700 per day (a 500 calorie deficit), then you will lose 1 lb per week. If you want to lose 2 lbs per week, you will need to cut back further to 1200 calories per day.

Of those 1700 calories, you will want to make sure that you get an adequate amount of protein and fat since they will make you feel more full than sugary carbohydrates.

Right now, you are eating a lot of rice and bread which is mostly carbohydrates, and the fruit you are eating (the dates and banana) are sugary compared to, for example, an apple or berries. You might want to steer away from this, but I understand if your food budget would not allow it. "

cquggze&SquaredCircle&MegGoesToSharkCamp&Most analysts think Vince is training the subscriber base to pick and choose with all the free months. The argument is he isn't generating a solid baseline of users, he's generating freeloaders who will cancel and resubscribe as they please.  Originally they were saying they would offer Mania 30 and reconsider it for Mania 31. People at the WWE basically told Vince people weren't going to go back after paying 9.99 and the general idea is that Vince has kind of killed the idea of Mania being a premium.

cqugh0m&personalfinance&truemeliorist&"Well, my best advice in the meantime is start programming in your free time. You have a computer, and there is a ton of free info out there (Stanford, MIT, and more all have free courses). So try it out. If you have an iPhone or an android phone, try writing an app you think would be useful. Teach yourself.

Hunting down information and methods for doing things is something you'll have to do regularly in programming, so doing it yourself before you're in school is a great way to build those skills.

The reason this is important is if you plan to get a job programming, a lot of places will expect examples of work you've done. From simple stuff like utilities you write to big projects. If you want to work for yourself instead, you need to be the one driving yourself to be at the keyboard programming."

cqugh14&summonerschool&LOLsolo&"Aside from winning lane (which Ziggs is good at, especially against Mord. I mained him in diamond last season), you should've won team fights with your comp. Yes, you have one main tank and bruiser top laner/tankish support. But you can zone Jinx out through landing your ult/placing your minefield towards her direction. Once you do that, basically your user will CC anyone attempt to go for your back line while you guys as a team focus that person. Unless it was Ali, everyone on your team could have focused. Or have Diana/Tristana dive into Jinx if she didn't respect your abilities. Mord was a bit fed but you have yourself to blame for that, he can one shot almost anyone on your team unless MR/QSS/Crucible are used. 

However, they did somewhat out pick your team. But the game is still very winnable if you play correctly along with your team, but they more so rely on you since you're the control Mage. On top of that, you had the benefit of Mord/Darius falling off (more so Darius)."

cqugh1h&FFRecordKeeper&juniglee&"Just a minor nitpick. I think you mean **Mental** Break, not **Magic** Break. Mental Break reduces a target's Magic Def/Resistance, whereas Magic Break reduces their Magic Attack.

I'm no expert in the JP meta, having only started JP last week, but I seem to recall that while Power and Magic Break are two of the most useful Break skills in the game, however Mental and Armor Break generally are not. If you use Vanille, you are freeing up an ability slot on Tidus in your example, to equip another more useful skill such as Dark Buster/Power Break, given that skill slots seem to be something of a premium in the game.

In that sense, Vanille's SB can help a mage-heavy team deal more damage, since it is multi-target. What makes it less appealing is I don't know if Deshell/Deprotega has a 100% status affliction rate, and how long the debuff would last for. For example, if you only run 1 mage, and afflict 3 enemies with it (think FFVI Imperial Camp elite), how long would it take for you to effectively get the most out of that SB? She'd also be great if you run a team utilizing Summoners, or a multi-target Black Magic.

Also, how potent is Garnet's all-Attack buff? I can somewhat agree with her being top, since dropping the ability to use Holy, to buff up to 4 other physical attackers is a good trade-off for DPS."

cqugh2p&hammockcamping&the_only_one&"The major problem I see is that you would be attempting to hang your hammock with a near-zero suspension angle with respect to horizontal.  If you don't know why this could be very problematic, play around with the hammock hang calculator linked in the sidebar. (Hint - watch the suspension tension force as angle w.r.t. horizontal approaches zero)

Additionally, the main point of a structural ridgeline is to create the same hammock sag every time you set up.  With your proposed system, the two hammock prussik knots would have to be totally repositioned each hang, unless the tree separation distance happened to be *exactly* the same as the last time you set up.  So what's the point of even having a structural ridgeline if you have to adjust the length every time you hang anyway?"

The game you are playing is free to play and Riot is a company so they want to make profit. Does it seem like robbery to you to pay for these skin? Maybe but it's still not 10% of the robbery companies like ubisoft are commiting so just live with it. Different ways for payment (like 1 at a time) are reasonable proposals but free stuff is a lot to ask for.

cqugh4h&personalfinance&0hypothesis&There's an argument that part of getting out of debt is about generating momentum. Not only does it give you a good feeling to retire out debts, the more that you close out, the less you need to keep track of as you continue the process. From that standpoint, making a mistake if you end up having a hard time juggling it could cost you more money than what you'd save if you went after the highest interest loan first. I'd close out the smaller ones. You'll feel great when you retire them and get some momentum to go after the last one.

cqugh53&starcraft&just_for_hearthstone&"Hm. What if instead of giving forcefield HP, make it a ""number of hits"" thing, like Phoenix's egg in Dota (or even the Changeling in SC2, sorta. in the sense that one hit will kill it regardless of damage).

To kill the forcefields, you have to hit it with n attacks, but the damage those attacks dealt wouldn't factor in at all. 

That would also introduce counter-forcefield *strategy* on top of the existing *tactics*, since you could make units that fire more quickly to counter the forcefields.

""Hm, he's going Stalker-Sentry, so I should really get lots of Marauders, but Marines do way better against force fields due to their attack speed...""

Of course, that last bit^ won't hold true in LotV as much, since Marauders will have a double-attack, but.. just an idea. Not sure if it's a good one.

Personally I'm in favor of reworking forcefields so that they're... not forcefields, but rather, regions in which your units would take say, DOUBLE damage (it would need to be significant). They might need to nerf mana cost/cooldown too if they made it like this. I think that would keep them as a viable means to control and zone your opponent, but get rid of the whole ""I have 5 sentries so you are never getting up this ramp, ever."""

cqugh58&smashbros&ZoroarkPKMN&"Palutena.

For starters, Palutena was my most wanted newcomer for Sm4sh. Her reveal trailer got me more hype than any other character. Kid Icarus Uprising, very obviously, is one of my favorite games (up there with Mario 64 and Monster Hunter). In terms of how she plays, Palutena is the perfect fit for me. She's a great mix of defensive play and offensive play. A lot of her aerial and smashes space and combo well, and some customs (Super Speed) make her an easy character to approach with. Though I know her flaws and how much of a challenge it is to overcome them, that only means I get to have more fun playing as her when I train. "

I've been doing a lot of this thin veneer style the past couple years. Even on CMU walls that could handle full sized stone. They have really cool products out there like real field stone and granite that's cut wicked thin.

Anyway, looks good. Now that you know how easy it is you can veneer anything!"
