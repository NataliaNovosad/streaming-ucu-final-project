cqugpap&TrollXSupport&BiologyButter&"That isn't the main issue, though.

The big issue is that he was dishonest and disrespectful about our established bounds. He broke a promise that he voluntarily made in order to satisfy himself. In fact, he broke a promise that I gave a very easy out for, since he merely had to let me know that he had changed his mind. 

This post wasn't about my specific relationship with porn, which you seemed to have latched onto. It's about the fact that my current SO broke his word, twice, on an issue that was very damaging to me previously. My body image issues have arisen due to a mistrust between us and a sense of being unfulfilled in bed. I'm not insecure about his porn use specifically, but about the fact that our sex life could be much better and he was choosing fulfill his wants when I had communicated with him numerous times that we needed to have sex more (and that one of my kinks was being unmet).


Edit to add: My self-worth isn't based on if he and I are having sex. But, there's a difference between him just not wanting sex at all and him getting off on a regular basis instead of having sex with me. In the first case, he isn't rejecting me, he's rejecting sex/getting off in general. In the second, he's rejecting sex with me in favor of a quick fix. Porn is fine if it doesn't impact sex life. His use, according to him, was impacting our sex life. "

cqugpcj&videos&ReturnWinchester&"Thousands of people clip along at 80mph along I-80 perfectly legally every hour without (or with very little) incident. But if you try and do 80mph down Broadway in NYC, you're gonna have a bad time. Likewise, if I-80 is covered in half a foot of snow and you try and do the speed limit, you're gonna have a bad time. A ""safe speed"" is entirely dependent on your situation and the conditions you're faced with. If we want to make the roads safer, reducing speed limits is a cop out and doesn't address the real reason why accidents happen (even ones where ""speed was a factor""). What we need to do is make safer drivers. Equip them with extensive training and give them the tools to make safe assessments of their surroundings. This is exactly why the German autobahns are safer than US highways, because in order to get a driver's license in Germany you have to go through a rather rigorous driver's ed school. "

cqugpco&DebateAnarchism&Butt_chugger_X&"You really dictionary-ceptioned me there so this may not be the best response since I'm on my phone but here goes:

First you defined the word 'just' using a self-referential description. The definition of just I see on merriam-webster.con says, ""agreeing with what is morally right or good"" and ""treating people in a way that is considered morally right."" So by that definition regardless of if they willingly gave their labor for free, I don't think it is just to take advantage of that for profit.

And what I am suggesting is possible, it is called a workers cooperative. If the entire community (company) has equal say in the direction of the company and they know that they are more competitive working together than separate; wouldn't it logically fit that if they are greedy they will work together to generate more profits as a community?

As far as generating revenue for expansion it works like any other company, the owners would take less pay in order to pay for the things the company needs. And by owners I mean everyone in the co-op.

And if you wanted to work for for lower pay than someone else and apply for the same job as someone else my co-op and I would choose the person that fits in best and add them to our list of equal owners. 

Lastly, i disagree that democracy is a failure, at least not direct democracy."

cqugpep&skyrim&Xenris&"To start, I'm not really well-versed in TES geography and lore.

Vedril, an Altmer, was raised as a warrior in the Summerset Isles, and wandered around all of Tamriel to help others and slay evil. Y'know, the whole wandering hero thing. He was rather well-versed in spells, learning to summon beings from other realms and Restoration spells (my explanation to why he starts with Healing) to sustain himself in fights, as he didn't trust his skills in Alchemy. He was also an accomplished blacksmith and enchanter, and took pride in his creating his own equipment and collect artifacts.

Contrary the the stereotypes against Altmers, Vedril respected other races' culture - however, he did not respect people that attack him or innocent people. As a mage and a warrior, Vedril followed two rules: Never kill innocent people and never use Conjuration for raising the dead: they've died once, they don't need to die again. Though he called himself a wandering hero, he had no problem stealing from others and manipulating others through his words.

He eventually wandered into Skyrim, as he heard of the Civil War and wanted to help those in need. However, as he entered into the border, Vedril ran into Stormcloaks. Assuming he was a Thalmor, the Stormcloaks began attacking him, which caused Vedril to attack them in defense. That's when the Imperials showed up and captured the Stormcloaks and Vedril. As he was approaching Helgen, he then blamed the Stormcloaks for his capture, and would join the Imperials for his new-found hatred from Stormcloaks -not for their worshiping of Talos, but because they got him captured and essentially made him lose all of his equipment."

cqugpet&AskReddit&prsplayer1993&"I'm not so sure, to be honest. According to Phillips and Axelrod's *Encyclopedia of Wars*, it stands at 7% of all wars caused, and less than 2% of the death toll.

I'd say more wars are a result of empire-building and maintaining, by different groups at different times.

This is, of course, not to say that religion has not been used to commit terrible atrocities, but only that it cannot be seen as the cause of more war than any other ideology or goal.

cqugph5&syriancivilwar&Chaucere&"I have to be frank -- this is pretty fucking stupid. 

It's one thing to go fight as an individual without children, or one that is older and has grown children, but to leave one's young children in such a situation is pretty low. The good she can do in this world through being there for her children is many many times greater than the small contribution she can make to YPG. 

Before you label me sexist, I'd say the same thing for men in her circumstances.

I'm guessing that she suffered from some level of ennui/existential despair in the United States and wanted to find a new greater life purpose. Interestingly enough, that ennui is also what often motivates people to embrace Daesh/other jihadi groups. The [of course significant] difference lies in what values are embraced as representing the 'higher purpose.' Fortunately she chose those of PYD. 

edit: I looked at her facebook. She's with the Peshmerga in Iraq, not YPJ in Syria. "

cqugpja&LifeProTips&KeyofE&"It all goes back to who is statistically likely a more reliable debt user. If you close accounts, your credit score can fall for two reasons. You may be closing your older ones, which would reduce the average age of your accounts, making you appear on paper less credit experienced than you were with them open. You also will be decreasing your credit limit, which means that having the same amount of debt now looks worse since your debt to credit ratio has increased. This is factored as you utilization ratio, the higher it is the lower your score. Raking up debt makes you look risky, and having a full account will lower your score. 

Most lenders want safe bets, even if you end up paying less interest. A person with a great credit score will likely have a high credit limit but low utilization (less than 20%), a long credit history, and multiple forms of credit (cards, auto, mortgage). They also most likely aren't applying for lots of new credit all the time, which is where the hard hits come in. These all show that the debt user is responsible, meaning that the bank will likely be paid every month, even if they don't receive the high interest and fees like they may from a poor user."
cqugpjb&summonerschool&Immortalone9&From what position is he giving you trouble?  In the jungle he clear is still very slow, even with Cinderhulk, and he can be punished early.

The moment he ults the adc the support can knock the adc out of the fight, making his ult knock-up useless.

If you can, use a large vessel for the blow off. I didn't. http://i.imgur.com/F6Wy2kI.jpg http://i.imgur.com/99WYFVM.png I also used the liquid yeast and these photos were the next morning when I checked on it after pitching at around 1am. So maybe 6-7 hours! And that room was about 60° f. 
I'd still highly recommend the cold crash to drop out all that hop matter. There's a ton and a tight trub/hop residue will minimize losses. 
It's a fantastically delicious beer. Blows away everyone that tries it. I fined with whirlfloc but it still chill hazes badly but after a few weeks in the fridge (I threw them all in to preserve hop flavor and aroma once carved properly) it clears up amazingly. 
Cheers!"

cqugpkz&fantasywriters&jgstep&"Thanks for taking the time to read and comment, I'm glad you liked the story.

I looked over the ""your"" and ""you're"" issue and fixed the ones i found, so thanks for pointing that out. 

Regarding why Werryn didn't just run off: I'll admit that it was strictly a plot device when I came up with it. He does have a penchant for games of chance, however, so I'll try and find a way to make it logical. 

I wanted Cornido to seem somewhat inept. He's inflated by his sense of superiority, but he doesn't have as tight a grip on his subordinates as he thinks, hence Werryn's numerous escapes and the fact that Lethah treats helps him (to an extent) once her master leaves. I'll try and address that.

I was noticing the dialogue thing too as I was editing. I will probably try and temper that on my next revision.

Again, I really appreciate you taking the time to critique. Thanks!"

cqugppx&leagueoflegends&Imoa&"I don't feel its naive to say that its team hopping at all, every roster he has left has been publicly stated to be his own choice. I think that it is just rationalizing in his favor to attribute some shadowy falling out / dropping to his situation.

Your second point confuses me a bit. You are absolutely right in that he joined elements and it didn't work out how he wanted it to, and that Fnatic now want him back. However I don't see how those are pertinent points to the idea that he is simply following success rather than creating it. They want him back, but that doesn't mean he isn't riding on their coattails (to take steal your phrase).

Don't mistake this for hate, I do not dislike Rekkles (although his social media interactions leave a LOT to be desired). He is an extremely gifted player and I hope he does well on Fnatic (big yellowstar fanboy), but I think that my opinion is pretty justified considering the kind of information that has been released to the public.

cqugpq5&conspiracy&BlindedByLights&"The problem is that the legislation being put forth (e.g., SB277 in California) require all vaccination -- even for non communicable diseases -- before education. Being vaxed at age 5 for a sexually transmitted disease (hep b) is more important than learning how to read. It just doesn't make sense. But if you say that, you're called a nut, a kook, or compared to Jenny McCarthy in an unfavorable light. It's a freaking witch hunt funded by the pharmaceutical companies. As such, even asking the question or thinking alternatively than the mainstream story is avoided by doctors.

OP: I highly recommend looking at the Japanese vax schedule. Vaccination as a practice is great. Vaccination as it is practiced at the moment is seriously suspect.

cqugps3&skyrimmods&Haker10201&"I'm going to be brief in my reply, not to be rude or anything, but because I have a massive english final I need to write for tomorrow lol.

I would call deviant artwork a hobby, because that's what it is. Do people draw for money? Yes, all the time. Do people draw as a hobby? Yes, all the time. Do the people who profit off art outnumber the people who do it as a hobby? No. Just because you put a lot of work into something, and end with a stellar result doesn't mean you're instantly entitled to get paid for it. People don't *have* to let others use their mods. They can easily make a mod for themselves, for their own personal enjoyment, and I'm 100% sure that some people do exactly that. Hell, I've even modded some games with my limited experience just so I'd have a more enjoyable time playing. Plus, there's a difference between artwork and mods. Artists have to buy paint, buy canvases, buy brushes, buy boards, stands, etc. There's a lot of cost that goes into art. Even digital art takes some investment somewhere along the line. However, modders get to skip most, if not all, of the investment costs due to the tools that are readily available for them to use. They don't often, if ever, need to create a modding program from scratch, just so they can create one simple mod for a game they like to play. 

I'm not trying to devalue their work though. I have seem some absolutely amazing mods that exceeded all of my expectations. I've also seen some mods that were so horrendously made that I couldn't fathom why anyone would let other people download it. But that's what modding is. It's putting work into something you love, and letting other people enjoy your efforts. That's exactly what a hobby is, and I stand by saying that modding is a hobby. 

I played Dark Souls II on PS3 when it first came out, and ended up buying all of the DLC around 5 months ago. It took me about 6 non stop agonizing hours to kill the Fume Knight for the first time. Did I enjoy it? In a sense, but not really. Was it hard? Hell yea it was, that fight made me go from thinking I was halfway decent at the game to basically complete shit. However, in the end my work paid off and I beat him. Should I have gotten paid for that work? It's something that I enjoyed doing, and it's something that I put a *lot* of time and effort into completing. 

Also, just to be blunt, comparing paid mods to slavery is just an ignorant analogy. You can't compare human lives to a byproduct of boredom and an impressive skillset with coding. If you really want me to bite, then I'd have to say that if things really can change, then we'd all be slaves to the gaming companies if paid mods do go through. How much longer would it be before we're paying $2 for every patch we have to download for the games we play, or $0.50 for every door we want to open in-game? And yes, you're exactly right, this should have been labeled as ""third-party DLC,"" because that's what it was. It was basically getting the community to do the work that the companies didn't want to dedicate resources to. If paid mods did go through, why would companies even need to create any DLC or expansions at all? They could just get the modding community do to the work for them, for 25% of the profits. 

There's so many more issues with paid mods that I didn't cover in my post, but in the end, the community's voice was heard (more like valve's wallets were turned upside down). I hope this kinda thing stays gone, because while I am an avid fan of DLC, expansions, and pre-ordering, I only have so much money. I'm not paying $5 for each of the 300 mods I want to use when Elder Scrolls VI comes out."

They found the ruins of a fort in Thuringia, and found coins and other artifacts in the surrounding area, including Poland, but the discovery of the fort hundreds of miles from the Rhine AKA 'the border' of the Roman empire suggests that the Romans were militarily active in that part of the world.

And those people were certainly Germans, as the Romans were certainly Italian. No ethnic bloodline is pure and Roman forces were multinational, and subsequent German tribes drove out the tribes that resided in what is called Germany today. Those tribes migrated into Europe and eventually mixed in with the ethnicity already in Roman Europe. "

But when I was searching for a B10 farmable team before I got him, every team had Acasis in it. When someone asks for a farmable team for B10 in June, Acasis should not be part of that ""farmable"" team, because odds are, they won't have Acasis, and/or weren't around for the HoH. When a past HoH monster is basically recommended 95% of the time as a ""farmable"" line up, it doesn't do them much good.

I'll try to do a little more research on that and elaborate on it during my mini-review, but yeah...haha.

cqugpuw&worldbuilding&bGivenb&"You're right there. The trees are from an image, and filtered with to match the rest of the aesthetic. I tiled them and spread them out where I needed forests. I hope writing 'sketch' wasn't misleading, but the image is ~90% hand done on my wacom bamboo tablet, the mountains are based off of a reference image of my world machine render. You're right about the filter, but I used selective Gaussian blur, and a cartoon filter to achieve the final look.


_________________________________________________________________________________________
Workflow:
_________________________________________________________________________________________

The first step was to render out a world in world machine. I'm a terrain artist for video games by trade (check out my [portfolio](http://givengames.yolasite.com/)), so this was the easy part for me. 

In photoshop, I started with the terrain shading; nothing too complicated, just a simple three tone shadowing with a nice big stroke, and roughed in the main landscape, I referenced my world machine render with greyscale height and topo lines heavily, but I took an artistic licence in a lot of the details. And brought in a smaller brush to bring out the smaller details of the landscape. 
[here](http://i.imgur.com/xSAToGX.png) is the reference I used.
To give the lighting a nice soft look, you can use the blur tool and run the Gaussian blur filter frequently. 
I'm flattered by all the comments about it being a real terrain image, but it'd honestly be pretty shit looking if I didn't use such a low res.



Each element is a different layer in photoshop. The cliffs, grass, and desert are quickly masked out, don't really bother getting too complicated with this, just slap some color in there. 



The shading layer is overlayed over my color layers, and presto! It's already looking like something I like. 



The next step is creating my forest. I cheated on this part (because fuck drawing out 1000 tiny trees). I used a satellite image of some trees, cropped and tiled a small section, and ran some filters on it. BOOM! forest layer.



The rivers are then painted in over everything. I pull the finished river layer out and put it into a new image where I overlay some waves that I quickly sketch in and tiled. They are then placed back into the main image.



Lastly I run a selective Gaussian blur filter over everything, to smooth out the shading and bring everything together, and finally run a cartoon filter to give it the pen and ink look.

 I personally think the Hull series will have limited functionality when it comes to defending itself from a surprise attack.
 
However, there will undoubtedly be a mechanism for unloading those ships.  Given enough time (and that time could be surprisingly short), a Hull E loaded with already-piloted ships could jump into a system, get prepped in a corner, and dump all of the ships to then ""hatch"" and fend for themselves.
 
This isn't too unbalanced because A) it isn't much better than just simply having all of the ships fly there on their own and B) they are pretty much sitting ducks the entire transit time.
 
Additionally, while you could deploy all of these ships - what about refueling/repairing?

cqugpzb&DotA2&Gokko&"I mean he definitely has counters, and the best one is bursting him before he gets a lot of damage out. Once he uses BKB your physical damage carries are your only hope since by the time BKB wears off he's done enough damage to contribute meaningfully even if he does right after. PA, silencer to ult after he uses BKB, and other carries with a damage item or two plus a Daedalus are going to be the main way to ""counter"" him as effectively as possible. Skywrath will be great to help burst him if you can disable him  outside of BKB and the silence will be godly against him on par with how effective it is against storm spirit. 

Above all else, I think Pugna outclasses all other counterpicks from how thoroughly nether ward shuts Leshrac down at all stages of the game, and his effectiveness is completely item independent, just needing a few levels in ward before Leshrec is no longer able to survive around him. "

cqugpzw&churning&LevyWife&"[here's the info for it](http://www.samsclub.com/sams/pagedetails/content.jsp?pageName=creditMarketing). they'll make you jump through a few hoops. the rewards are year round, up to 5k total in cash back per year. you can get gas from Sam's Clubs, Walmarts, and other gas stations, but I think other warehouse clubs don't qualify. here's the kicker: once a year (I think Feb) they mail you a rewards check and the check has to be cashed at a Sam's Club. I believe if your membership is not valid when you go to cash your check they won't give you the money.

ah, yes, here's the fine print:

*Sam’s Club MasterCard cardholders are eligible to earn cash back rewards on purchases made with their Sam’s Club MasterCard account. Rewards apply to net card purchases (minus returns). Rewards percentages depend on the type of purchase made (5% for gas purchases at U.S. and Puerto Rico Sam’s Club and Walmart fuel stations, and at Gas Stations located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico (but excluding purchases at fuel stations at wholesale clubs (other than Sam’s Club), certain supercenters, and supermarkets), for up to the first $6,000 in gas purchases each year and 1% thereafter; 3% for dining and travel purchases (excluding purchases at wholesale clubs other than Sam’s Club) and 1% for all other Eligible Purchases). Maximum of $5,000 in Cash Back rewards can be earned in a calendar year. Cash back checks are issued each February for the Cash Back earned during the previous calendar year. Cash back rewards are forfeited if the Sam’s Club MasterCard account is not in good standing, if the Sam’s Club Membership terminates or lapses, or if the Cash Back earned in a calendar year is less than $5.00. Cash back checks will be made payable to Sam’s Club and may be cashed only at a Sam’s Club location. See the “How to Earn Cash Back with your Sam’s Club® MasterCard®” rewards program for details."

cqugq0i&occult&RadicalZig&"Depends on what you consider to be ""using"". 

Every day I try to better myself, meditate, learn something new, etc. I have a never ending list of books to read and skills to learn. I try to make every action I take a reflection of the bigger picture. That is definitely magical. 

In terms of specific rituals and actual nuts and bolts craft, its a pretty rare thing. Life has taken care of me well, and when it hasn't, I've always learned more than I could ever hope. I do the best I can to play the field as it is, not as I want it to be. The instances where I think my personal will is worth projecting over the existing flow are few, and I usually have better success following synchronicities and reading the signs along the way so to speak. My last ritual was making a talisman out of an object of immense personal importance. 

I guess the tl;dr would be: constantly yet selectively "

cqugq0q&CHIBears&Sideshow_Slob&i dont think my body can take this
cqugq0s&Twitch&One_Rocky&"Hey man, hopefully I can lend some feedback: 

 1) If the name pops up on screen somewhere, then I dont think it matters to also mention it in a thanks. The benefit of thanking viewers outweighs the slight 1% chance that a few lurkers might get bugged by it. It is, after all, a 1 time thing. Its not like you call them out everytime they are in the channel. 

2) Depends on how you build. If you provide content and get followers through other means, and then reward them with giveaways, well thats different then just marketing yourself as a giveaway channel.

3) Yes this is bad imo. Buying their way in is opening yourself up to stuff in the future like when you get lots of donations are you going to make them all mods? of course not, so scrap that idea now, you need mods you know and trust. A non-donator might make a better mod than someone who donates, never know. 

4) I too used Moobot a while back, then dropped it like a bag of potatoes when i found the Nightbot/Ankhbot combo. 

5) Nope, i enjoy seeing all types of art and styles, its great to see what the community comes up with! 

6) Twitter really is #1 in social media. Look at the biggest names in Hollywood...the first thing you can access to them is their Twitter. Why do you think this is? Get a twitter yesterday. 

7) Just socialize and when you meet true friends you will know. Then choose those ones to hang with on stream and do coop streams, etc.

8) I would assume that charities are usually a good thing :)

9) Branding is an important thing, something way too long to explain here. but yes the logo and everything should all blend, no old pictures man. 

good luck, best wishes

- Rocky

Even if she didn't expect your game to take that long she should be content with the fact that you did what you promised- contact her after the game.  This is accountability, this is good enough in my book. No partner of mine has ever had to explain their every move and exact time frame of said moves. Yeah sometimes I felt disappointed when things didn't work out the way I'd hoped. It's not always great to be waiting for someone's text if you expect to hear from them. I get that.

Secondly, when you picked out what I thought was the least relevant portion of my response, I didn't have much to say that I thought would be interesting or very relevant to the conversation at large. So I made a joke, instead.  What was I supposed to do, ask you to respond to a different portion of my comment?

Show time was 9pm and I had little else to do that evening so I was there at 8:30, grabbed a beverage and found myself a good spot. New sound guy at the venue was having a hell of a time getting everything going so they were just finishing up line checks at about 5 past. Then the band leaves the stage to ""get ready"" for 10 minutes. Already 15 minutes into their set time they're finally starting up. Standard four band bill usually means 40-45 minute sets with 10-15 minute change overs. These guys started 15 minutes late and played a 65 minute set. When they finished they took their time breaking down what little wasn't backline, and 3/5 of the band took their gear and left during the middle of the next band's set. Wasn't even on the bill and I was pissed at these guys. "

I use condoms and am on prep to protect myself (a low dose of Truvada antivral/hiv medicine to prevent getting HIV). [More info on prep](http://prepfacts.org/)"

I'm currently having second thoughts because of the following things: Antiquated government regulations for business and practice, dismal pay, almost a tumbler-esque SJW liberal groupthink in the industry. Not the shit I'm willing to put up with for a median income of 43,000(us) no matter how many people i help

cqugq68&makinghiphop&badtaylor&"i'm not being a dick. your original question is phrased so broadly as to be unanswerable. this is why i asked focusing questions in response.

there are a shitload of synths inside FL studio. it depends on your version # and edition you got. the easiest one if you want to learn how to make your own sounds is probably 3x osc. if you just want to jam immediately use fl keys. the best one bundled with FLS is probably sytrus.

most people get 3rd party synths like massive, sylenth, nexus, omnisphere, or any number of solutions. you might try googling ""synthesizer VSTs"" to see if there are any that jump out as promising to you.

lastly, i think you should begin to understand why questions like ""how do i add synths or chords to my beats?"" are frowned upon. you should have googled that. even in the ""no stupid questions"" thread, it is selfish to ask us to hand you information that is readily available. you will not make good music without a personal drive to learn."

Especially with the shit that is put into cigarettes to make them stronger (more addictive). Smoking inside the house, if you have kids, is irresponsible and mean spirited. Smoke lingers, and even when the smoke is gone the smell is still prominent which can also set off a reaction.

If your kid doesn't already have breathing issues, if you smoke in the house (even if he isn't around or you ""blow towards a window"") you're making it a lot more likely he'll develop it. If you want to be irresponsible with your own body, go do it outside in the backyard or something. Stop being a shit parent/sibling/uncle/aunt/etc..."

If Internal Affairs  (or whomever) is investigating you, you can't ""plead the fifth"" and not answer their questions about how you conducted yourself on the job. I think the flip side is that the information they may obtain can't be used against you for criminal proceedings - you may get demoted or suspended or whatever, but they're not allowed to turn that info over to prosecutors  (they have to collect their evidence on their own). Someone who knows more about this should probably elaborate/clarify. "

However, i think my cheat sheet for the final exam was a lot more useful than it was for the midterm. I didn't fill it up with facts I remembered anyway, but rather only the things that I had actual difficulty remembering, or had the possibility of forgetting while working under time pressure (like those common phenotype ratios for specific genetic crosses). 
I LOVED everything ecology, haha, and evolution/phylogenies as well. It just seems to naturally sink into me. I didn't do well on the second midterm that focused on genetics, which brought my grade down... But from that, I knew what I had to focus on for the final (paid extra attention to genetics...

I am not brigading, I just browse /r/funny and saw this post (horrible, I know.) Most of us aren't delusional. However, iPhones and Androids are very comparable. Without competition, Apple wouldn't have gotten this far, and frankly neither would have Google. I like both phones and so do many others. I would suggest not commenting on the brigadier's posts because that would make them comment even more. I was just trying to offer my opinion and the point of view of an Android user.

Randy is a GREAT example. You will never see more shirtless beer bellies in your life than in the Dartmouth/Preston area. 

Julian is another great example of a certain kind of person you see there -- the kind of shady entrepreneur. Like, someone you know would have done really well in life if they had a better upbringing. They don't fancy themselves gangsters or criminals, for them it's all selling stolen sheet metal, or trying to turn a profit on some big pile of tires they found somewhere. They like to dress as fancy as their limited budget allows. 

Ricky is sort of a combination between a few different cliches, but yeah, for a lot of people, growing dope is simply legitimate employment, and a lot of his character traits like his shirts, hair, living out of his car, all on point.

The trailer park itself is such a great depiction of the east preston area that if not for the more elaborate plotlines involved, I'd believe it was a real place."

cqugqff&MonsterHunter&DevEndgame&"Deviljho went to the Dunes.
He was looking for food to steal.  
He was half alive, his stomach was deprived    
He needed a hunter as meal.  
So when he found a young hunter a-huntin', and playing that Hunting Horn hot,    
The Deviljho jumped up, pinned a Rathian's rump and said ""Boy let me tell you WHAT!""   
""I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a hunting horn player too  
and if you care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you.  
Now you there is a pretty good support player but you gotta give the Devil his due,  
I bet Crook of gold if I could eat your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.""  
The hunter said ""My name's Deathgod and it may be a sin...  
I take your deal, and I won't be a meal, because I'm the best there's ever been!""  
So Deathgod you better make sure you got tinged meat  
'Cause the Jho rules these parts and he's never been beat  
And if you win you get a carve and a Crook made o' gold  
But if you lose, the Deviljho eats your soul!  
  
The Deviljho roared and said ""I'll start this show...""  
And saliva flew from his jaws as he pulled out his Vangis Horn, complete with a blood red glow.  
As he howled into that Hunting Horn it made an evil hiss  
A band of Diablos and Pecos joined in  
And they sounded something like THIS!  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbRXl6cgZ9o  
Deathgod just laughed and said ""You're pretty good, ol' son!  
But just trip into that pitfall trap right there, and I'll show you how this hunt is won!  
Pickle in the dunes before the rising sun!  
Bring some drugged meat and the battle's already won.  
If he pins you, just dungbomb him and go!  
Don't get hit, hit it until it dies - that's what all hunters know!"" 
  
The Deviljho was bout' to tunnel away, 'cause he knew he was beat  
So he severed his tail and laid it on the ground at Deathgod's feet.  
The hunter said ""Jho, just invade my hunt if you ever wanna try again...   
But I told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best there's even been!  
Pickle in the dunes before the rising sun!  
Bring some drugged meat and the battle's already won.   
If he pins you, just dungbomb him and go!  
Don't get hit, hit it until it dies - that's what all hunters know!

cqugqfz&DnDBehindTheScreen&KronktheKronk&"I couldn't disagree with you more.  Sure, players lose out on the rabbit hole of super character customization, but there were too many problems with DC creep and OPness in the earlier versions where the goal has and still seems to be ""line up around the bad guys and roll dice until they die""

I like that you can make a character in 5e in 20 minutes and have a plan for his future.  I like that a DC 20 check is really really difficult at level 1 and still mildly difficult at level 20.  I like that there aren't 25 skills to put points into, maiming everyone not intelligence/skill point powerful from doing things other than combat.

I find the simplification and condensation of the rules lend themselves to much more lively role play by everyone, and not just the skill sluts in the party."

I played with son, he did dishes and dinner, I ran around with him after dinner, washed him up, brushed his teeth, chased him around the apartment trying to get his PJ's on, got them on and sung lullabies and put him to bed.Now I'm just enjoying quiet time and about to step out for fresh air on the back porch!

I was in a Subway inside of a little mall and a guy approached me and asked for money to buy a sandwich. Because I was an idiot, I thought to myself ""well, a dollar won't get him a sandwich... but $5 will..."" and handed him a $5 bill. He thanked me and then left the restaurant.

Though looking back on it, I don't know where he went. There was a McDonald's across the hall and I like to think he went there since he could get more for the $5. But I'm not sure. I haven't given money to anyone who asks since though because my innocence was shattered that day realizing that people weren't always honest."

cqugqny&Fitness&Onepieceru&"You are working in a rep range you have never trained before. 1RM calculators and estimates based on different rep ranges are bogus. If you want a good 1RM, then train it. 


Story time: Based my percentages for higher reps on a 1RM calculator. Surprise, couldn't do it. I think it was a gruelling 275 lbs. that I couldn't get up. I normally did a 5x5 routine and thought it would transfer over better to 1RM. Just because your muscles dont exhaust at 4 reps with less weight, doesn't mean you can recruit your nerves and flex and stay stable enough to lift a heavier weight safely. 

This really bothered me so I switched to Bulgarian style. In 4 month I squatted 365 lbs. But my 5 RM barely changed ~295. It's because I stopped training 5 RM's and only focused on 1 RM. Does that make sense? You are not magically going too to get better at a specific skill (1 RM squat) by training your 5 RM squat. And yes everything will affct you, including mental state and sleep."

cqugqpc&leaves&mortokes&"Different methods will work better for different people, and I think the mod said it best. If you are going to do it this way the most important thing is to set rules and goals to help you achieve quitting- and stick to them!

Rules like no smoking alone, no smoking during the week, only smoking outside... whatever will help you to smoke less. And goals  like ""go 3 days without smoking, go one week without smoking, resist a craving...""

If you find yourself ""changing"" the rules or goals to justify getting high then it's not working.

I want to suggest that by attempting to wean yourself off, you may be dragging out the withdrawl symptoms. Instead of going through a couple rough days/weeks and then feeling much better you might be making it last a lot longer, since every time you get high and feel better *temporarily* it's like starting back at day 1. You likely won't start feeling some of the benefits of quitting like a clear-head until much later. But as I said different methods work better for different people.

If you feel like cold turkey isn't working for you, if you try making goals to go longer and longer without smoking, maybe you will start to see more of the benefits of quitting and be more dedicated to it. It's really hard to quit cold turkey when you still love weed, but if you notice how good you feel (after getting passed the withdrawls) and are more serious about quitting completely then cold turkey won't be so difficult.

Best of luck quitting, making it entire days without smoking is a great accomplishment! If you take it one day at a time you can do it!"

cqugqrb&AsianParentStories&Jajamola88&"East Asian concepts of filial piety and absolute respect for authority create a cultural environment that is incredibly hospitable for abusive parents/spouses. There's also the communist revolution/civil war that happened in China/Taiwan and created a generation of emotionally stunted people and paranoia. 

Then there's also the fact that East Asia was heavily agricultural and the way rice grows means that you need everyone to work together without question. This system leads to low value for individuality, and high value on the needs of the whole group. It also explains why Asian parents are extremely prone to grooming their kids for college a certain way just because everyone else is doing it. There's a consistent formula for farming/weather, the thought pattern carried over to everything else. "

cqugqu4&KerbalSpaceProgram&ashamedpedant&"Since you're new: ""thrust"" is how much force the engine puts out when it's running. ""Delta-V"" is what you need a lot of to get to Mun. Delta in mathspeak means change, and v stands for velocity. To make a craft that can change it's velocity by lots and lots, it helps to have rocket stages and to minimize the non-fuel mass of the upper stages.

Once you're in orbit it's generally better to have a lightweight puny engine that can run for a long time than a heavy powerful one that uses up all its fuel in 2 seconds. This is because it takes work to carry a big heavy engine around.

The other thing to look at is the Vacuum ISP for the engines. This is essentially their fuel efficiency. High ISP engines give their exhaust lots of velocity which (due to conservation of momentum) means your spacecraft gets lots of velocity."

He dump me for one girl, broke up with her for me, and while we were back together we planned to go overseas to work (we both were going to do it anyway, just agreed on the same place). During this he was talking to her the entire time and ended up bringing her overseas to work where we had organised to work. I could see her bedroom form mine. Needless to say, they are together now. 
cqugqui&soccer&FuckGodPraiseSatan&"Oh my bad on the Fletcher thing. I thought he had left but when I checked whoscored to see who United had available in that position he was still listed. You're also right about Mata not being a natural CM though he has appeared there 10 times this season according to whoscored and Fellaini has appeared there 14 times this season based on the same source. 

That still leaves Herrera, Di Maria, and Blind.

Maybe it's not the deepest position at United but I still believe them to have more depth there than out wide. "

As far as the gameplay goes it never felt very strategic in that it really ended up with everyone just piling onto everyone else in a massive blob with the kitted out commanders dueling in the center.

There were capture points to make it strategic, but this never really mattered as if you didn't pile all your forces into the enemy they would break your people and win pretty quickly anyhow. And after all that, the only thing that really mattered was the commander and making him as badass as possible just so that you could beat the opponent's commander, and whoever won that basically won the game. In the end it had nowhere to go strategically; there was no room for dynamic gameplay."

cqugqw9&StandUpComedy&MasterTre&"I also think it's a good thing to remember that words only have as much power as you give them. If I made a decision to suddenly take offense to the word potato I could also demand that others couldn't tell me that it was inoffensive.People need to stop giving the words of a stranger so much power over their emotions. I've heard that friends use fag and faggot in the same way black people use nigger amongst others of ""their own group"" and have even let friends use it. And that whole situation where ""only we can say it"" is beyond ridiculous and only proves my point, that it's all about intention.A word is only offensive if it is being used to offend, or on offense. Getting upset and offended at the mere existence of the word. Is asinine. And only serves to create more instances in the future for you to get offended."

cqugqwi&wargame&SmokeyUnicycle&"Overall its quite good but there's some stuff I take exception to: 

Tank and infantry CV is likely more optimal, you don't need 9 cvs. 

Tank cvs will still die to cluster artillery like the smerch readily, infantry will not. 

Top armor only matters for cluster weapons and LGBs. (this was a little unclear) all other AOE weapons will hit side/front/rear armor. 

1 armor takes full HE damage from shells and bombs, 2 takes .4 so a 2 av all around unit is quite resistant to blind artillery. 

Helicopters can arrive at the front and return refuels far faster than trucks, so in tandem with an fob are a much superior option. 

When only allowed five cards of infantry in an untyped deck to say you should always take MANPADS is flat out wrong. (you mention this later)

No mention of vehicle fodder, no mention of CEV. I am dissapointed. 

No mention that the super cobra has only a 50% chance of killing one helicopter for 115 pts. 

No mention that the DAP is second only to the TY-90 

Your comments about SEAD missiles are false. 

Turning off the radar after the missile has been launched will cause the missile to impact the last known location of the radar unit. 

Usually this overlaps with the current location of the radar unit, but if fast moving or wheeled it can in fact escape in time. 

Not much mention of superheavy combat, or town and forest combat. "

At this point you don't need Heavy Armor enchantments on your gear. Maybe magic resist enchantments would be a better choice, because magic ignores your armor."

cqugqxd&FanTheories&Ssutuanjoe&"Then what was the point of Morgan Freeman mentioning that the ejection mechanism had been fixed at some point (Chris Nolan has never been one to strike me as a director to throw completely non-pertinent pieces of dialogue into a story just for the hell of it)?  Or how about Catwoman being there at the cafe with him (Alfred didn't know they made any kind of deal and he didn't have any indication that they'd wanna meet up.  I don't even think he ever actually *met* her as a significant character)?  And the fact that many of the main characters have blatantly stated that the end of the movie isn't fantasy (Yes, yes...Nolan *himself* hasn't said it...but people close to him certainly seem to believe the ending was genuine)?

I can't help but feel like you're dismissing one interpretation of an ending for another.  There's only one moment in the movie where it makes mention of Bruce and Alfred seeing each other in Florence, and there are many moments that would (in my opinion) support how Bruce could have pulled something Batman-ish out of his ass and escaped the explosion.  Bruce also knew it was Alfred's wish, and maybe he just wanted to grant that wish for him?    "

Electricity is .10 kwh.  
3x290x does 2300h/s on claymore's 9.1.   killawatt shows 830 watts at the wall with cpu idle.  
.830x24 = 19.92 kwh
19.92 x $.10 = $1.992/day
income estimates to $1.08/day
1.08-1.99= -0.91 (loss)
so even though my hash per watt (2.77h/w) is better than yours (.6h/w), I am still not profitable.  Though I only mine when it is cold outside so that the mining costs will be offset by my heat cost savings.  I will not likely mine anymore this year, unless there is a price spike for monero.

Again, I really do think it's meta dependent. I think there are some match-ups against which Nefarian is better than Ysera, and others where Ysera is better. I don't think Nefarian would see tournament play mainly because tournament metas tend to have more BGHs than ladder. I think if the ladder had a lot of Druids, Priests, and Warrior, then this card would be better than Ysera in, say, a control Warrior deck."

cqugqzo&explainlikeimfive&GroktheCube&This is a somewhat complex question. The side effects of anabolic steroids are generally mild, at worst comparable to hormonal birth control when used at moderate doses. The FDA, DEA, and AMA all recommended against making them controlled substances. Their legal status is even more indefensibly stupid that marijuana.That said, the argument against allowing free reign in sports is that they do have potential health drawbacks when used in high doses, and many athletes would feel compelled to use them in high doses if it were allowed.At this point, I think the biggest reason they're still illegal is stigma brought about by media hysterics, much like what was seen with marijuana up until very recently.

cqugr2j&politics&[deleted]&These were climate scientists going out to document how all the sea ice was disappearing.  Instead, there was so much, it took two ships and a helicopter to rescue them because the first rescue ship got stuck.  Sea ice to that extent does not just show up after a few days of cold, it takes solid amounts of time to build up.  Furthermore, they were stuck in the summer, which is supposed to be the time when the ice would normally be reduced, but it was still crazy excessive, far more than they thought. That is tantamount to a scientist saying they're going to study a drought and ending up nearly drowning in a tsunami.

I think this is pretty close from what I can tell!  The girl talks a little excessively but it's a decent tutorial.

I know it seems silly to curl your hair if you're just going to brush it out and style it, but it gives your hair more ""movement"" and actually makes it easier to style for looks like this.  My hair is pin straight but I get good success with retro and vintage styles after using pincurls or hot rollers.  Good luck and please get pictures of the result! :)"

I had some success with chugging and then quickly drinking a chaser like apple juice, something with a lot of flavor to drown out the disgusting laxative taste. It definitely is best cold, and DON'T SIP IT! Drink it as fast as possible, using a straw at the back of your throat is a good way to do it, or pouring it down your throat while thinking happy thoughts works. I have definitely started heaving a few times, if you do, just take a break. It isn't worth all the effort just to puke it up!

Also, tell your doctor about your troubles and they might switch it up the next time. I told my doctor that it was making me puke and he told me to only drink half the next time, which definitely helped. 

I remember drinking barium contrast oh so many times for CT scans, and they were even worse than the golytely somehow, probably because they taste like a radioactive banana flavored chalk milkshake. Guh, they are so thick and the nurses are like nazis, forcing you to drink a bottle of it every 10 minutes. It was hell.

You have to consider the information they should be sharing about their lane when action isn't really going on. I'm not an expert by any means, but to assume that the only comms that go on or that all of their comms are like the ones in the highlight reels is just an overly presumptuous statement in my opinion. I'm sure their communication issues stem deeper than that, but honestly there is no way to know for sure without having access to them in full.

They want to be free to criticize, judge, and manipulate and direct others, but do not themselves want to be held to the same scrutiny. This one thing I have just said is the thing which stokes their ire the hardest, because they can't face the fact that after all this time, for all of their good behavior, they would have to face Lucifer and still see that he is their moral equivalent and that they aren't any better.

cqugr6h&roosterteeth&ToFurkie&"I'm just gonna say it but I'm not a fan. The show has no direction. Honestly, it's a reaction show but sort of diluted and isn't quite sure what it wants to be. It almost seems like an accelerated talk show and, again, without direction.

A comment in the comments of the sponsor video, one person points out something that's is a good point. Almost the entirety of the episode could be put into or has been put into other segments of shows.

* Funny internet videos brought up constantly on podcasts
* The Know segment about the shit storm surrounding Kojima was covered before, twice. Actually, three times. Dude Soup, The Patch, The Know
* Outtakes could be put into RT Life, considering it was off screen banter filmed while taking a break. Sounds RT Life-ish to me
* The challenge round was fun to watch but... there's already an RT game show that utilizes challenges during the middle of the show that this could have easily been used for.

Honestly, the only thing that seemed like it fit this talk show/reaction style video is the interview with Miles. It was information that may have only been briefly brought up or simply covered on another video. Having it interview style fit this a lot better than other methods. Then again, if they wanted to do behind the scenes plus additional info about RvB, it is very possible to put out an interview type video with Miles on the recently available RvB Youtube channel.

It's a pilot so it makes sense that there isn't much direction as of yet. It's a starting point and is figuring out the niche it wants to be. My only advice to improve the show is give it direction, a focal point. Right now, it's pretty much a disjointed talk show."

cqugr9t&SQL&Majache&"I've been using Visual Studio, how do these compare it terms of establishing a web app that makes calls to an SQL database?

 I've experimented in labs with Northwind, using MVC as well. They go together pretty seamlessly but all of it was done with Entity Framework. Which threw together my app without me doing much. Now i'm sitting here with a relatively functional webpage that does queries and lets me edit the database with the 3 default options (create,edit,delete). Yet, I found it puzzling to work out how to add more options and pages that will let me do even more to it. The codes all there but I'm still left wondering how to utilize it to my will. 

ie adding onto it with more ID's and tables, What keys to past to it, normalization of the DB, beginner stuff.

cqugra4&IAmA&RowYourUpboat&"It's subjective, but I could argue against that. Ramsay Bolton is basically just a rabid animal - a psychopath with no capacity for empathy, and no emotional need to have relationships with people. While he has his place in the Game of Thrones world, he's an ultimately hollow creature, however terrifying.

But Walter White... the truly, deeply chilling thing about him is that he started out with a relatively typical personality, and then a series of emotional blows and ego-trips and twists of fate ended up having him do more and more monstrous things. And each time he descended lower - ""Broke Bad"" - you could still see there was a very human logic behind Walter's motivations, even while each of those steps down took him further and further away from humanity."

PRC support was crucial for the viet minh, they were given an unassailable strategic rear once the CCP won the mainland in 1949, plus a huge amount of logistical and advisory support. It's hard to overstate just how crucial this was to ultimate victory over the French. During the American phase Chinese units operated SAM batteries in the north and quite a few Chinese soldiers were killed in this undeclared air war. It was only later that cooperation turned to rivalry.

cqugrat&hiphopheads&SwagDracula&Just curious, since you are on this forum (so I assume you like Hip-Hop) and you're clearly pretty far from the Men's Rights dipshits on Reddit, how do you consume Hip-Hop? This genre is riddled with misogyny to the point where it's part of Hip-Hop's identity. If the sexism isn't explicit objectification like Slick Rick, it's often implicit (male gaze, male mc's being favored etc.). Do you draw a line somewhere? because if Slick Rick bothers you, I assume Rick Ross, Project Pat, Juicy J, Cam'ron, Dr. Dre, Tupac, Snoop Dogg, and plenty of others probably bother you in some ways too. Just wondering since I support/sympathize with the women's rights movement, but I also still listen to R. Kelly (who is by all accounts a terrible person) because I feel like I can separate them in my head.

You can even be four eating on it ""folded"" in (it doesn't actually fold, so don't know what to call it), if there is only plates and cups on the table, not the actual food.

It also depends greatly on how comfortable someone is with sitting around a table leg, and also with which chairs you choose. I suggest going to Ikea and trying out the table and chairs with it.

cqugrb2&fantasybaseball&ChateauDeDangle&"Is it a keeper? If not, I wouldn't trade Dickerson and Myers for him. You're right, if Cutch doesn't steal 30+ bases he's basically the same as Dickerson, possibly with less RBIs. Though I don't think it's accurate to take sample sizes and extrapolate them over an entire 162 game season, however, Dickerson's stats last year over a full season would have propelled him into a first rounder. Though I'm not necessarily sold on Myers quite yet (though he is very talented), I would not flip Dickerson and Myers for Cutch in a non-keeper quite yet. I have a feeling you could revisit that trade at any time this season as long as Dickerson doesn't find himself on the shelf for his plantar fasciitis.

cqugrbu&AskReddit&Andrew_Waltfeld&"I'll take a stab at the question since slideforlife... provided such a dumb explanation. Men get replaced all the time in leadership positions in one way or another. Mostly because again: In these type of positions the question is: ARE you capable of meeting your job requirements always? Yes/No. If the answer is No at any point during your job, then you get replaced. 

When you are in project management for example (millions of dollars on the line), you cannot simply be replaced for 9 months while pregnant. No way in hell will anyone ever let you into that leadership position. You can't simply swap the project management manager out like a cog and expect everything to go smoothly. It simply doesn't happen. You have deadlines to meet. Your job *is* that project. 

Unfortunately, I've seen and heard of men get replaced because they had asked time off for the first couple of months when their child was born. The company made bullshit excuses of course, but you know the real reason why. Money. When you have these type of high value projects on the line, either you make damn sure you aren't distracted during the length of the project or you get replaced. That's just how it is. That's why women are having a harder time getting into higher positions especially in STEM related fields. Most of those higher positions involve projects where you can't simply disappear for 9 months and expect to have a job after. AFter you finish that project, you move onto another project and so on. Hop project to project. "

If I watched a video like that, and then saw that the follow up was that the officer was fired and charged for what he did, then I would be able to say ""there's just a few bad apples"". But the reality is that the worst punishment the officer in the video is going to see is maybe a few days of paid suspension, and he'll be back patrolling the streets again.

cqugrdy&arduino&scswift&"Oh, one more feature I forgot to mention, which the Neutrino has but the Teensy lacks, is the ability to switch seamlessly between USB and external power.  With the Teensy you have to cut a jumper on the underside of the board if you don't want VIN to feed back into the USB bus or vice versa.  

I found the Teensy's solution was kind of a pain when you have already soldered together your board.  When testing, it's easy to forget and leave the power on when you plug the USB in to reprogram it, and if you cut the jumper, it can get annoying to have to turn the device on to program it."

cqugrhr&offmychest&datingisconfusing&"Hmm.. I just made a post earlier about battling depression.. It was very upbeat and it made me question if people would judge me for it. Maybe some people might not believe that I have had it for a decade on and off and that I was diagnosed by a doctor(psychiatrist) who prescribed pills to me. I had a negative effect within days of taking those pills so I chose to go down the natural path, which takes a bit longer but I believe is longer term as well. It gives you the chance to discover things about yourself, deal with your problems in different ways and become more resilient. 

I chose to try and change my negative thoughts into something positive by forcing myself to do certain activities that benefited me. Every small step felt like I had the weight of the world on my shoulders but that's how you do it, step by step. We have to start somewhere and we can't rush recovery. Overall, the change is within yourself. Some people might judge and say that I'm not supposed to have this positive mind set. Like rocketshipray said, some people may seem happy on the outside but that doesn't mean that they're not struggling. It doesn't mean that they still aren't battling demons.

Also, I agree with you wholly when you say that accepting something negative leads to worse outcomes. You're 100% right, people dwell on their situation because it's sort of like an addiction, an addiction to sadness. It gives a bittersweet comfort that we cannot grasp. If we force ourselves to smile, we can become happier, which is further proof of what you said."

I can see why some people would be attracted to the velcro cap thingies, though I wouldn't be one of them. The main problem I see is that the soft floppy material one would be mounting these velcro cap thingies to is not designed for such work. It will probably de-laminate or deform pretty quickly. 

Back in the day, Nikon made a couple of hard-ish leather cases, with metal F bayonets in the bottom, on which you could mount your lenses, so they wouldn't go rolling around and damaging each other. People bought them, but obviously the idea never went mainstream."

I believe that if he had scored the header that was saved only a few minutes before the headbutt, it would have propelled him into people's memories in a different way.  He would have won two World Cups, with two goals in each game.  

I'm not sure he is my greatest of all time, but I do think there is a good argument for him being the greatest World Cup performer of all time.  Had he scored on that header, there is no doubt he would be."

cqugrjk&DestinyTheGame&xaoshaen&"There's a lot of speculation in there. Perhaps the most unfounded is that there's some massive number of people who can't handle raiding in Destiny. I'm entirely willing to take my chances in CE with a mix of random 31s.

I'm not sure what to make of the sudden outpouring of concern for the well-being of new raiders. I maintain that giving more people an opportunity to raid is better than denying them that opportunity on the grounds that they might find themselves in a 'bad environment'. Yes, some people will be put off by the experience. Other's will take to it. In the end, increasing the pool of raiders is good for everyone.

Why on earth would Bungie nerf the difficulty of raids in response to complaints? Presumably the masses of people that can't complete a raid with matchmaking can't complete a raid now. If Bungie is that malleable, why haven't they already nerfed the raids to make them more accessible in response to people's complaints? A hypothetical response to a hypothetical backlash is pretty shaky grounds for, well, anything."

cqugrjw&photocritique&Tacogasm&"Compositionally, I love the photo. I think you have a nice foreground against a beautiful background. If i were to be nitpicky, i would say crop the photo when shooting (not post), so that you move in a little, and lift that bottom end up and tighten the edges.

You already admitted that the exposure is a tad over, but do you shoot in raw? If so, you can easily move the exposure down in editing and it would look killer. Also, as I'm sure you know, just take that iso down to 100. Always try to keep ISO at 100, and manipulate other settings for exposure, as 100 iso will get you the best quality.

cqugrmy&aww&ttott100&"I think the shelters just take their chances for the benefit of a faster adoption.  They pretty much just hope the owner will fall in love with the dog or decide to stick through any unexpected issues that might come up.  In a perfect world no one would have to fib about any of the animals, but if they were to label half of their dogs as pit bull mixes then those dogs would clog up the entire facility and not allow new dogs in - so I can't entirely be mad at them for it.  At the end of the day, the small fibs probably save the lives of a lot of dogs.  It's annoying, and a irresponsible, but I can understand why they take the lesser of the two evils I suppose.

My shelter requires you to sign a contract to return the animal back to that specific shelter if you were to change your mind, but I'm pretty sure they'd prefer you just handed it off to a friend/family member that wants the animal.  It's probably just a way to prevent people from abandoning their animals in the streets or neglecting/abusing them - many people won't return to the shelter out of shame or guilt but having a binding contract lets them be free of those feelings if they wish to part with their animal."

cqugrnv&starcitizen&MrHeuristic&"I didn't make my wasted space argument well. And you can't really see it in my image. 

The wasted space is going to be the areas of your screen that the hologram doesn't even occupy. The escape menu covers your entire screen, so there's plenty of room for UI elements. The hologram, though, is an object in space that you walk up to. Unless you walk all the way up to it (but not too close, or buttons get cut off! Ugh) there's going to be areas where it's not 'projecting'. Which is fine if they're utilizing the space they actually *do* have well. But they're not. Buttons are literally overlapping, and there's lots of them. They're making up for it only taking a portion of the screen, by hiding everything away in pages and pages of sections. 

This wouldn't be too bad if this was an occasionally used interface. But this is a key part of the game: fitting ships with modules, upgrades, tweaking things. We're all going to be spending a LOT of time in this UI. Clicking through 10 screens that could have been combined into 1 or 2 big ones that take up your whole monitor is gonna be *exhausting*. My opinion of course, but I'm not pleased. "

And yeah, I'm like your friend. I actually can't literally hold some animals as I'm allergic to pet dander but my family has always taken the time to nurture fragile things back to health (not that we're vets or anything). But my mom's an RN. So I guess she subconsciously raised us to try and save anything we could.

Last summer we found [these guys](http://i.imgur.com/vAQwcSh.jpg) running under cars in the middle of the street. They were too friendly to people and were definitely abandoned, so we held on to them until wildlife control could come care for them. 

My sister in law once found a box of kittens on the railway tracks. They fortunately were able to find homes for them. But yeah, its tragic.

Btw, I'd never heard of algae bioreactors. Those are amazing! Now if only we could find a way to corral all HAB, especially here near the Great Lakes lol... :("

cqugrpt&AdviceAnimals&Arafiel&"I graduated with an MBA about 1.5 years ago about 60,000 in debt.  Was it worth it?  To be determined.  That said, it's not the end of the world if you land a halfway decent job.  The main issue is that about $830 of my potential savings for retirement/house/whatever is going away each month to the loans.

That said, here's some advice:
1.  If you live in the Midwest - leave.  Go to NYC, Boston, DC, San Francisco or a similar city.  Cost of living is higher, but so are your salaries.  $800 out of 80-100k is painful but very doable, $800 out of $40k...not so much.

2.  If you have graduate loans - refinance.  Sofi.com is great, I dropped from the standard 6.8% federal rate to a 4.2% which is going to save me a lot of money in the long run - and also allows me to invest extra money rather than put it into student loan, on average I can expect a better ROI from investments than the 4.2% I'd save from paying loans off early 

3.  Cut back on expenses - if many jobs in the big cities come with nice Perks - like free food.  I spend very little money on food each week which is a good $200 savings.

4.  Join a solid startup.  This is a bit more iffy, but if you join a successful startup (not early stage) you can expect a few thousand stock options.  Will it make you a millionaire and should you count on it - no.  That said it's a much safer bet to get a good 50-100k payout at the end than the lottery, and your salary is usually good too.

5.  Watch your credit.  It's amazing the Perks credit cards give you with nice credit - including hundreds of dollars towards vacations, clothes, etc that won't have to come out of pocket."

cqugrqs&DestinyTheGame&TastyBleach&Either random drops from strikes, but this isn't really recommended, or buy it from the vanguard vendor. this needs marks and atleast vanguard rep level 2. This is where a lot of people quit the game because it is a grind - do the bounties every day etc, and you  can do the lower tier weekly strikes and I think public events give you marks. I'd recommend buying boots or gauntlets first - probably boots as these are the cheapest (65 marks each I think?) then if you have ~14 strange coins you can buy your first exotic from Xur! At your level in the game I'd recommend saving your coins for when Xur is selling an exotic helm or chest for your class, as these will replace the need to have a legendary in this slot and coins are easier to come by that the 130 marks (I think?) to buy a helm or chest from the vendor. Make sense? -this is assuming that you play PvE, if you predominantly play PvP then you can buy legendary armour from the faction or crucible vendors, but acquiring crucible marks is slower than vanguard marks.

cqugrrr&AskReddit&shesallover&"I think the idea is, the pounds you are over or under your ideal weight, will benefit you more if you are over.
I could gain 60 pounds and I'd be 180 pounds, and have something nice and soft to sit on for once. I could suffer severe illness and have a greater chance of a faster recovery. I'd stand a better chance of surviving a serious car accident, statistically, as well as childbirth. At 180 pounds, I would survive longer during cold water exposure if I was in a boating accident. I could still bike everywhere, and be shit at stairs. I'd be fat. It would be fine.


If I lose 60 pounds? I ded. 

No seriously. I would *be dead*. 

So being overweight has more benefits than being underweight, pound for pound, yes. 

That's not ""pro-fat propaganda"" that's just ""Your body can deal with being overweight more than being underweight"" Plenty of peeps out there are 320 pounds and still alive. If I was 200 pounds underweight, I'd have negative mass. I'd be superdead."

cqugrty&personalfinance&w3djyt&"I don't know if anyone has recommended this yet, but you can do a lot of your grocery shopping online these days. A lot of areas have local ""pick up your stuff and drive it to your door"" type services. Also, Amazon Pantry has gotten very good for everything but fresh produce.

There's also services that will deliver meal ingredients to you so you can start cooking and becoming comfortable with that aspect of food management. 

https://www.freshnfitcuisine.com/
https://www.hellofresh.com/

Etc... those are just what I found on a quick google search. With how much you're already spending on Fast Food, you're likely to find a service that at least saves you a little each month.

(in Canada firefighters are first responders and go through paramedic training) He and his partner were picking up an extremely drunk aboriginal person and taking him to the hospital. The patient was  extremely drunk but conscious and aware of whats happening. Anyway the guy I met is driving his partner is in the back tending to the patient and the two of them are playing a game of who can call the patients ""daddy"" the most during the shift. So his partner is checking the guys blood sugar levels with some device and says to the guy "" ohhh you got dat high blood sugar diabeetus, thats why you so sweet daddy"" I laughed hysterically then we spent the rest of the night playing the ""daddy"" game.

cqugrvr&photography&carlosvega&"Focus and recompose is not the best practise when you use wide apertures like 1.4 1.8 2.0 or 2.8 or need to be really fast.

I use the multi controller to choose the AF point when I do, for example, street photography (and want to use wide aperture) (I know there are other techniques like focus trap and I do use it, different needs)

Also the full frame sensor gives you more quality with high ISO (due to bigger pixels) (like astrophotography or indoors). 

Also, and this was really important when I had my 60D, a full frame has a higher limit on diffraction. With my 60D (18MP) you could lose quality at apertures of f/8 but a 6D (20MP but less density of pixels) has a higher limit like f/16.

Look more information about that at Cambridgecolours 

The 6D is able to focus with -3EV of light which is awesome. (The 5d mk3 just -2ev)
And, again, the bigger (compare to the APS-C) viewfinder is gorgeous. 

Cameras like the 1Dx are able to choose focus patterns and to meter the light on the point you focus. These features can make the difference when you need to shot really fast. 

Also the dynamic range of the sensor is a big plus."

in the real world, it's often much more complicated: we deploy code that supports schema and schema+1, run data upgrades when a resource is loaded for the first time (or as a background task so we can drop schema-1)."

cqugryc&HistoryWhatIf&VitruvianDude&"Okay, this is going to be pretty controversial. It's not pretty, or politically correct, but this is the what-if that was thought of at the time.

Aguinaldo proclaims the Philippine Republic, but is immediately faced with a secession movement in the south. The British, French, and Germans arrive to temporarily restore order; they do and the British and French leave. The Germans stick around and turn it into a protectorate, which lasts until the Japanese arrive in 1915. They take over from the Germans but exploit the islands even more intensively and cruelly.

This is the situation that the US feared in the first place. Rampant imperialism meant that in the absence of a strong government, Asian and African populations were being steamrolled. For example, the British and French were very interested in taking over the Hawaiian Kingdom; it was the presence of Americans that prevented it.

So the McKinley administration rationalized that unless they wanted another imperial power there, the US had to suck it up and do the dirty work of being a colonial power. The result was a shameful war, but after its conclusion the Philippines were given a great deal of autonomy in preparation for independence while under the military protection of US.

The US had a hard enough time enforcing the Monroe Doctrine in the Western Hemisphere. I don't see how they could have said ""hands off"" to those land-hungry great powers."

To give you and idea, below are some screenshots showing what my current city looks like using this asset pack.  This is a relatively new city and only has Level 1, low density buildings, but very little repeating visible.  Once certain areas start to level up, and I start adding in high density buildings, will be even less repeating.  I will see the same level of variety as my city develops.

Another tip to get rid of of repeating buildings is to force different size buildings when zoning.  If you zone a block, first manually zone some different random building sizes that take up about 20% of the area.  Then let those grow.  Then fill in the zoning for the blank areas.  You will get much more variety doing this.

cqugrzb&rupaulsdragrace&thisisnotcontra&"This season's runways are actually outstanding in my opinion because you can take literally any outfit from the final tally and say ""Oh, that was for Death becomes Her"", or ""That was Jetset Eleganza"" compared to previous seasons where you have someone like Darienne and you have to wonder ""Hold on, what week did she wear this?"". The themes are actually interesting and give a lot of room to show versatility, and they're much more identifiable than past seasons' runways. Remember season 4 when there were two runways we didn't even get a theme for? Remember generic themes like ""fabulous drag"" and ""girly drag"" and how lukewarm those runways turned out? Even this season's ""Green"" theme was less than stellar, because it was very broad and only a few queens (Like MKD and Pearl) actually had solid concepts for their looks aside from the color."

The CPD started doing this in 2013 with the intention that constant fly bys' would somehow deter crime (it hasn't). It just annoys residents since the pilots fly the helicopters at such low altitudes. 

Another reason may be [b/c of dragnet surveillance as is being done in Chicago and over other metropolitan cities](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/planes-mimic-cellphone-towers-collect-data/), basically the region the pilot flies over gets all its' data usurped, stored and digested.

[Here](http://www.shaheen.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Shaheen-Portman_One%20Page_Summary_113th.pdf) is a one page synopsis from Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), the bill's co-sponsor. You can see that there isn't much on the sheet for homeowners. However, if you rent the building or part of it I think there are tax credits available for energy efficiency up grades. A lot of the federal tax credits for energy efficiency for home improvements came through during the Fiscal Cliff Negotiations - which Senator Portman played a key role in.

Efficiency also helps lower rates across the board, it's way cheaper to decrease carbon emissions by generating less power from coal plants through more efficient use and transfer of power - than building a whole new power generation infrastructure. 

It's hard to find a win-win for everyone in the federal government, but this is one.

There may be some aspects of Ohio Senate Bill 310 from last June that help you out. As I recall, that bill contained an amendment to give you tax credits to put in energy efficient windows, as well as other measures.

Full text of the Portman Bill [here](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s720)

Ohio SB 310 [here](https://legiscan.com/OH/bill/SB310/2013)

[This page](http://www.houselogic.com/home-advice/tax-credits/how-to-collect-tax-energy-credits/) should help you walk through the process. According to the IRS the maximum credit is $1500. I'd check with a tax professional, and save every receipt! "

You can tell who they are too because they'll start dorans ring and be useless for the entire first 20 mins (laning phase) as she stands in the bush or autos the enemy support while sniping cs. When she isn't doing that, she'll be rolling over dying in her free time, giving free kills to the enemy adc because she thinks its a solo lane and she  can kill 1v2. Then when she is 0/8/2 or something she'll afk because 'omg noob team can't carry' with her only item completed in the 20 minutes being sorc boots (because no gold income).

Perhaps, if the aid money for the poorer areas of the UK wasn't sent on the scenic route via Brussels (a trip from which around 60% of the money does not return), they might be far better off (on account of having had over twice the development funds). Instead, we spend billions on building airports every 6 feet.

Honestly, if you have good healers, it's just better for the tank to take a stack to prevent multiple DPS/Healers from dying since the stacks will fall off before the next bow phase.

Hiring the 100 people will entail a much higher cost of collaboration and collective decision making.

You shouldn't use drugs to make you feel better when you're upset, that's a really bad habit.  I recommend you stop using the Hydro right now, only use them once or twice every other month or so and if you can't do that then get rid of them before you find yourself in deep shit.  It's very easy for opiates to become a problem because they don't feel like a problem, they feel like a solution....to everything.  If you really need to get high that badly use something else, opiates aren't something you just take whenever you feel like it, because you will *always* feel like it.  Fuck getting in trouble by your parents dude, getting caught smoking weed is much better then getting sucked into opiates. Using opiates takes immense will power, more then most people have.

cqugs99&Pathfinder_RPG&Killchrono&"One thing I try to do is make sure I don't rely on perception and disable traps for everything. Mix it up a bit and have puzzles and traps able to be solved by a number of different methods. Think about all the skills available and figure out ways to implement traps that use them.

That said, don't pigeon-hole individual traps so they need a specific single way to be solved. If you're doing one-shots, then you don't know what talents your party will cover. Make it general enough so that they have options, don't just make it so that, say, you absolutely need spellcraft to know which spell is protecting the next room, or swim to cross a moat, etc."

cqugs9c&thalassophobia&heymeowmeow&"Well, I definitely browse by subreddit. Not all the time but quite frequently. Especially subs I'm very invested in like this one, TV shows I like, etc. 

The reason we instituted the Hall of Fame in the first place was to service both the casual users and the dedicated ones. For dedicated users, it gets frustrating seeing the same ten posts submitted over and over again because someone posted an /r/Thalassophobia link in a major sub leading to a big influx. On the other hand, for casual and new users, the hall of fame is a great way to say, ""Here's what the sub is all about. These are agreed to be great posts. You should see this awesome content"" So that way new people can see what we have to offer and people who have been here for a long time don't get clogged up with the same few posts. And I want to be very clear that neither subgroup of users is better than the other by any means. They just have different interests at stake and I think the hall of fame services both groups' interests. 

This may sound a bit hipstery but I think it really is true that as a sub grows it gets better until it hits a certain point where it becomes so popular that the posts become low quality. Unfortunately I'm afraid we've almost reached the tipping point. I've been here for years and I can remember a time when getting 50 upvotes on a Thalassophobia post was a lot. Now that we have more people, there's more submissions which is great! The problem is that we're also getting a ton of xposts of default sub posts that really shouldn't have been here in the first place. For instance, the jaguar swimming underwater at the zoo the other day. It was a cool clip but it really shouldn't be in Thalassophobia because it has nothing to do with the ocean or fear of the ocean. While I think that the user base should be the ultimate deciders of what is allowed, I also think that large groups of people can be very bad at identifying quality content so moderation can be very good for that. 

Anyway, to get back to the crux of the matter, I kind of agree that, if people want to see it and they upvote it then the people have spoken. On the other hand, there are guidelines to this sub and this post is specifically forbidden by them. I'll be honest, I was the user who got the hall of fame implemented in the first place by doing a meta post on the state of the community (under an old handle). If people are no longer happy with the setup, then we should have a discussion about changing the rules, and that's totally fine because i am by no means the arbiter of quality for this sub, but as it stands, this post is against the rules. So if people feel passionately that the hall of fame is an outdated solution, please, by all means start that discussion! "

cqugsah&Aquariums&MaydayTwoZero&"Agree, it's never complete.  

I don't mean this the wrong way because everyone has their preferences, but over time you may gravitate to some more interesting stock.  IMO platy/guppies are somewhat mindless despite their bright colors.  They don't do anything cool solo, and don't school together as a group (besides bang).

I've learned the hard way that it's best to focus on one or two great schools (tetras, rainbows) complimented by some fish that are interesting for reasons other than their schooling behavior.  IMO Bolivian rams, pearl gouramis, BN pleco, Gudgeons, Garras, angels, kribensis, apistogramma can be very cool alone.  Cory cats and Loaches obviously are very cool but prefer groups.

This is not at all meant to be a criticism by the way as it's all about what you like and preferences will change over time based on your experiences."

cqugsaj&FeMRADebates&dejour&"As presented the stuff is pretty shocking and unacceptable.  But I think naming and shaming would be a better approach here.  Also the full paper and review would be better than snippets.

I do have an impulse to wonder if this story is out of context since there is no naming.

For example, maybe this quote is relevant to the study:

“Perhaps it is not so surprising that on average male doctoral students co-author one more paper than female doctoral students, just as, on average, male doctoral students can probably run a mile a bit faster than female doctoral students""

I don't know what the study is about but presumably their study found that male students co-authored more papers than female ones and attributed it to sexism.  Maybe the reviewer had a point that alternative explanations weren't considered or investigated."

cqugscg&AskHistorians&XenophonTheAthenian&"Oh, wow...there's a lot of misinformation in that thread...The top comment's casualty figures are fabricated from thin air, as his his claim that Tacitus reports them--Tacitus reports 80,000 Iceni dead, to 400 Romans (and an approximately equal number of Roman wounded). That would be 200 Roman dead for each Briton, and only 100 Roman casualties for each Briton--but Tacitus' numbers are clearly wrong (80,000 is a ridiculous number--Caesar reports that at Alesia each of his soldiers received a Gallic slave from among the captives, so there were at least 40,000 captives *from all of Gaul* there, which makes this figure, like Dio's 230,000 soldiers in the Iceni army, patently absurd) as well. Tacitus also notes that the Romans fell on her camp and slaughtered the women and children, vastly increasing the casualty count. I also don't know why that comment has a reply to it that claims that Boudica attacked while the Romans were in the middle of ""rotating"" their legions, which he explains means that the legions in Britain were returning to Rome and were being relieved by new legions--not only did the Romans not do that, in the case of Britain it's nonsensical. It was a principle of the Roman army after Augustus standardized the number of legions that permanent frontier garrisons were manned by legions...permanently. Legions would remain on-station for years, sometimes centuries at a time, only moving if they were going on a campaign or, like the four legions that invaded Britain, if they were being moved to another province, which was rare. This was a standard practice, it's how we get towns like Mainz that were originally permanent legionary camps. The four legions in Britain appear in our sources as being stationed in Britain for several centuries after this--the Twentieth, Agricola's legion (which participated in the initial invasion and in the Iceni revolt), was almost certainly still there when Constantine III withdrew them to support his bid for the empire. The reason for Boudica's initial success in sacking Camulodunum was that whereas the city was literally right to the south of her kingdom, the legionary camps were miles away, in York and near Wales--the Ninth legion, trying to salvage the situation, marched in unsupported and was ambushed, with its infantry destroyed, though its cavalry managed to get the standards out. Suetonius, the provincial governor, marched in with the Fourteenth and parts of the Twentieth (all three of these legions had taken part in the initial invasion and all three would remain in Britain for centuries later) and snuffed out the rebellion. Actually...there's really not much in that thread that's not, at best, half-truths

For what it's worth, the OP's assumption that Boudica and her daughters met their unjust treatment as an official order, which as we have seen is the exact opposite of what Tacitus says, is not actually in the rather poor wikipedia article that he linked to, it's an addition of his own"

cqugsdq&linux&tuxthekiller&"Then you are actively avoiding seeing the errors. Look at Microsoft update and read some of the notes on the patches.. small things like 'ad user can elevate privileges to that of domain admin trivially.'

My favorite is when MS sends out patches that break things like oh say fonts.. How does one manage to break fonts -- and more importantly how the hell is font-rendering in the NT kernel space? 

Linux and BSD boxes are hosting a very large chunk of the internet and they are a huge target space - to pretend like they don't get targeted would be equally as bad as saying MS patches never seem to be 'important.'  

Linux machines aren't innately secure if they are misconfigured or left to bit rot with little maintenance and TLC, but they also are very reselient even as a massive target as long as configured and attended to in general.

I tried asking some nice people along the way how to get where I wanted, they stopped and answered my questions, but soon they were gone with their fast cars. These road are also not very well maintained, holes in the road, vegetation in the way, etc. I steer clear of those paths, but maybe thats where I am supposed to go? I think I see something far off in the distance there.*

cqugsiu&knives&oleictmo&Like any other steel common in knife making, if it has a good heat treat it will work for most users. I have a bionic 2.0 and it holds an edge well, a little difficult to sharpen because it is very hard, but mine polishes up well with a little elbow grease. D2 isn't stainless, but it isn't highly prone to corrosion either. That said, you may want to get the acid wash version to help protect the blade, especially if you live in a humid environment or are a particularly sweaty individual. All in all though I really like mine. It took some breaking in but it is a good flipper now.  My main complaint is the way the bevel flairs out where it ends at the ricasso. Pretty annoying while you a sharpening. Other than that it's a great small edc.

cqugsju&loseit&kathompson&"I'm the Triple-F gym user: fat, female, over fifty. And I totally get where someone's head can go when facing going to a gym and feeling like everyone else there is in shape and thin and perfect, and holy carpola THAT'S NOT FAIR. 

But then I think back to when I was young and fit and actually working in a gym. Not only did I not care what other people there looked like, I championed the overweight and out of shape because they were there to *do* something about it and were not there to hook up with someone or to stand around and be beautiful. 

If I had that mindset 30 years ago, when gyms were often meat markets or hangouts for guys who were there to just get huge, then I'm pretty sure most of the people in gyms now are even kinder in the things they think...if they're even paying attention.

All those years ago and I can only think of one time where someone said something terribly unkind about another gym member in regards to her weight, and she didn't even have the stones to say it where that person could hear (which was a good thing, but still.) And I guarantee, after saying it to me, she never repeated it...

TL;DR: 99% of the people in the gym either don't notice or don't care. And if they do care, they're probably on your side. Own it; embrace your quest to be fit, and know that a lot of people are on your side. "

cqugsk0&AskMen&theirisnetwork&"At least in the US, a big thing that I'm getting used to is this concept that a lot more places are able to serve beer and alcohol outside of bars. There's the obvious ones like restaurants, but where I live now coffee shops also serve beer as well. Shit, I just discovered last week that there's a coffee shop/bar that's also a laundromat, so I now choose to get drunk there while I'm doing my laundry. 

Coupled this with me living in the Midwest for a couple years has built up my tolerance higher than it should be, I have no problem nursing a beer and just relaxing for a tad. That being said, I don't think I'd go to a bar necessarily. Those places for me still have the weird stigma that if you go and sit at the bar alone that you've got nothing better to do (which is sort of confirmed in my area ). I know this is not always the case, but it's a hard stereotype to crack. "

Then there is honor, integrity, etc and then we tolerate clowns and asshats. A navy commanding officer handled her ship so dangerously that a helicopter went right off the deck with the pilots inside. They died. The navy's solution? Promote her. What the actual fuck? Or perhaps we talk about building people up, making them better... unless they make a mistake. Just one, then they are right the fuck out and on their ass.

Fuck fuck games, the green weenie, Big Navy, etc. If we were interested in solving the issues we would treat one another as professionals or at the very least as adults. But we won't because shit will happen then same as it does now, but at least the current regime means that we are doing ""something"" about it all. Right?

I imagine many stories fail the test when there is a male protagonist, especially in truncated media like movies, because you don't have enough time to develop every background element to the same detail.  That would be an active hindrance in surreal works.

Well, you did say UNbalance instead of imbalance, so if that is not your meaning I recommend using the latter instead.

Passing or failing the Bechdel Test doesn't actually tell us if the representations are equal or not.  Most romantic comedies for example are all about sex relations so it may strain a very fair screenplay to change in order to ""pass"", unless it was done in a very trivial way that would seem to undermine the point of the test."

In the 2nd interview he thinks Adnan called him after track at quarter to six (probably the 4:58 call), thinks the Nisha call lasted 7-10 minutes (it was 2:22), adds a visit to Cathy's in his confusion, thinks the ""come get me"" call was after 3:30 (it could only be either 3:15 or 2:36), left Jenn's at 3:40 (probably off half an hour), that sort of thing. 

I would think it suspicious if Jay were saying, ""um, then Adnan called at, um, a little after 2:30, 2:35 ... we talked to this girl for, I don't know, 2 or 3 minutes and it was about 3:30."" That sort of thing. 

To me it's clear he just doesn't have knowledge of exact times, nor is there a clear sequence of events that he's adhering to because he's studied it or has it in front of him. That's as it should be, though - he's recalling a day he's thought about but it's 2 months in the past. And it's not like detectives had a firm grasp of exactly what happened and when at this point. Jay came in and told them a lot of new stuff, and explained why he lied and all that. They're still figuring this guy out, so why show their cards? But for sure, it wouldn't hurt for me to go through it all again."

We had an issue with a husky that lived two doors up jumping on their shead and getting into everyone elses gardens, she was adorable and did no damage but its a little shocking to look in your garden and see a massive dog. They moved the shead away from the wall and the dog managed to find a way over the small area of the fence (the back gardens are on a slope) and so they use an electric fence to keep the dog on their property and the dog only needed to wear it for about a month before she got the message and was moved back to her normal collar.

cqugsmj&summonerschool&zzresolutezz&"The #1 that comes to mind that is also mobile, would be Jax for top lane because he has a jump on short cooldown. He is a bruiser and can beat tanks because of his R, passive, and usually building BOTRK. Aatrox also has a jump and he has the crazy sustain from autoattacks. Most of them have a bit less mobility but other AA bruisers include Xin Zhao, Trundle, Olaf, Warwick, previously AD Fizz (rip... he would be perfect for you but got nerfed).

I feel like Riven and Renekton are also pretty high dps but rely less on autoattacks.

For the dps mages most of them aren't mobile especially because many of them are very old champs and that was how Rito's designs were. Two that don't really have mobility but at least have utility are Ziggs and Anivia. Ziggs' mines are a huge slow and his satchel charge can bounce you to safety. Anivia has her ult slow and her wall. These are good zone control champions along with dps. Brand and Cassiopeia are known for being good tank busters. Other examples are Xerath, Karthus, and Vel'Koz.

You're right that it isn't really just two distinct categories of burst vs. dps, there's plenty of in-between champs. There's a wide range."

cqugsrk&personalfinance&bo_dingles&"Fine. Account for every penny you earn. What are you spending it on- did you **need** to spend it?  

You can live off a beans and rice frugal diet and spend less than $25/mo on food. 

Are you living somewhere you can't afford?  

Do you need the car? 

Where else is your money going?

You say you take home $1200/mo and your bills are $1100. If that's accurate that's $100/mo in discretionary (wants) spending. If you don't have a cushion where you're not getting overdraft fees, then you don't have money to buy a thing you want. 

Your credit card debt is around a third of your yearly income, that's high.

How about your car note, and your student loans, how much is left on them?

cqugss3&LifeProTips&PokeChopSandwiches&"Don't feel dirty. They treated you with the respect the customer of high end automobiles deserve. It should be the standard. Part of the price in theory includes the BMW or Audi or whoever experience. By treating you in such a manner, they are acting, not speaking. Telling you with action that as a customer you are valuable and they understand what you can bring to the brand. Furthermore, your dealer in particular seems to be completely on its game. That speaks very highly of quality owners and management. 

Sadly, even among high end autos, your experience is not the standard. Don't feel bad. Just reward the dealer with your purchasing power and give them priority in the future. The dealer is betting that their time and equity investment in your will return itself in 4-5 years, maybe sooner. Rewarding them with your consumer choice will ensure not only continued good treatment for you, but for all customers. 

Considering the financial power and buying practices of high end car guys and girls, it's surprising that your treatment isn't the standard. When I bought my last Porsche, I drove an extra 50 miles to return to a dealer that treated me in a similar manner. Didn't even consider the closer one. All because dealer 2 had bent over backwards to cover mechanical failures that were very gray area on the warranty, and could be reasonably denied by claiming I was racing the vehicle or abusing it. Dealer 1 denied it in about 30 seconds. 

It's a godamn Porsche. Of course I was racing it. I spent 20 years of my life dreaming about doing just that. 

Congrats on finding a friendly dealer. Keep them close. A good relationship with a dealer can literally save you thousands of dollars in the future. 

And really, isn't it nice to pull up to a car dealership and not have to spend ten minutes applying lubricant to your asshole, to prevent chafing from the pending ass pounding? "

cqugssj&amiibo&RedStarburstsAreBest&"Amiibo: Pit

In Box or Out Of Box: Doesn't matter since I take my amiibos out of the box anyway.

Packaging: Any is fine! I'm not picky.

Reason: Pit's been my favorite Smash character since I first played Brawl years ago, and I'd love to get his amiibo. KI is such an underrated series (if you haven't played Uprising, go play it; you won't regret it), and if not for Pit being in Brawl, I would have probably never played it at all. Sadly, I missed my chance to grab a Pit amiibo when they were first released, not knowing the full extent of the amiibo craze at the time. I don't think I'll ever find one for a reasonable price, and I can't afford to pay the price people want for him now. I'm a poor high school student lol.

Thank you so much for holding this contest. I might not be as active in the amiibo community as most of the people here, but I love seeing people like you spread the generosity. Best of luck to everyone entering =)"

cqugsvv&gundeals&oe800&I hope it works too. I would also think sending in the physical packing slip (if they include one) should work.
cqugsvw&DestinyTheGame&exxtrooper&"Yes it was indeed not hit by the nerf that hard.

It was 20 damage to the head before, now its 19, against anything more than 200 health it required an extra shot, but you don't often end up getting all headshots anyway.

Probably the most viable AR out there right now."

cqugswc&amiibo&ElCamo267&"Amiibo: Shulk

In Box or Out of Box: doesn't matter

Packaging: doesn't matter

Reason: xenoblade chronicles is my favorite wii game of all time. I've beaten it several times on my wii and am working through on my 3ds at the moment. So of course I wanted to main shulk in Sm4sh. Basically, I tried to get him but couldn't find him and refused to pay more than retail value. So my reason isn't unique in any way, it happened to a lot of people. Regardless of the winner, props to you OP. You're a cool dude/dudette. "

cqugswv&funny&LastArmistice&"I watched this episode with my family last night, who usually doesn't 'do' absurdist comedy.  My dad watched the whole first season and thought it was trash.  It had them all in stitches.

This is by far one of my favorite episodes of the whole show.  Even their one-off sketches were great.  The bonfire sequence, the Knot Store, and the Allergy Pride Parade were all amazing, but the Battlestar sketch had me in tears watching it."

cqugswz&AskReddit&BillyTalentfan&Not asking her out sooner
cqugsx0&listentothis&speedyortiz&"I think it would be more akin to ""selling out"" if we were to write and record music in a style we feel we've outgrown just to appease people who preferred our first album. We're really proud of the new stuff we've worked on. We stuck with the same independent label who released our first record and funded all of our recording expenses with money we earned touring. I'm not exactly sure how that means we've gone too far with the mainstream promotion. We've been playing music a long time; more publications are aware of this time around because we literally spent the last 2 years packing all of our shit into a cramped van and sleeping on people's floors so we could drive all around the country and play our songs. We've turned down lots of high-paying shows and endorsements with companies we disagree with ethically. 

If that equates to ""selling out"" then I guess that we are HUGE FUCKING SELL OUTS"
cqugsx2&GreenBayPackers&Crashnburn_819&"I get the ""lolcutler"" view on it, but it's not just because he's Cutler. 6 years remaining on a $125m contract for a 32 year player is not something you rebuild with. Thankfully for us, Jay is untradeable."

cqugsxl&gaming&iamthegraham&Where's Channing Tatum?
cqugsxm&vita&PSYCOMAN27&I felt that the pacing was really poor, leaving most of the time spent wading through text for the next case, the characters were very one dimensional, essentially only being tropes, and they were always on the extreme when it came to their reactions leaving them entirely uninteresting, and the social interaction system was thematically inconsistent, unecessary as skills earned through these conversations weren't really needed to make it through a trial, and with no interest in the characters I found no intrinsic reasoning to engross myself in these activities, essentially making them padding (of which the game is rife with). I also found that the game has no sense of subtlety leaving the extreme scenarios really without contrast to anything else, and the sense of humor was mostly just innuendo and referances to the tropes of visual novels and other forms of media (Though I actually enjoyed some of these). The actual trial segments were actually much more intense than that of Pheonix Wright, but everything else in the game seemed like a chore to me and I was unable to press through everything I didn't like to get about 15 or so minutes of enjoyment from the trial segments.

cqugsyb&politics&Sixpack_Sticks&"We also have a lot of people clocking in to jobs and surfing Reddit. If those jobs could be cut to parttime and paired with parttime jobs elsewhere, we have more than enough people. I could be wrong, of course, but it seems like most people with jobs are struggling to find things to do.

I look at even places like Google. They redesign their gmail experience every few months, never improving, just shifting things around. It's almost like they have too many engineers and not enough work for them. Again, I could be wrong, but I doubt it and it is interesting to think about.

What I am firmly against are backroom deals like the TPP done in smokey rooms where nary an American can influence the rules of the day. Smells **sniff** unAmerican.

I would like to see a possible US where the imigration flood gates can be opened. Let those Mexicans nobody wants make GM cars, let them make Fords, but pay them well for it. Rekindle the American dream."

Hopefully someone will come in here with actual advice.  Being a guy, a hetero guy, I really can't tell you anything that I would feel confident about.

ADC: You misspelled Forg1ven.

Support: A player that wasn't even Top 2 at any time of bis career. Also washed up.

If that is the EU Superteam EU is fucked and should be switched out for Japan at Worlds. "

cqugt1b&pathofexile&RaufossMK2&"Missing needs to give feedback. sound or animation. you could speed up the first part of the animation and slow down the end, so it appears like the character was striking hastily and needs additional time to keep the balance ( working against the momentum of their own weapon). this would work as a system on top of existing animations.

a sound would probably be better though. 

in the past i was very often not sure if i missed or was desynced and that won't go away entirely for those who need the old system.
A lot of people also have a pretty bad idea of the importance of accuracy. the fact that you essentially have to understand the crit/accuracy formula and the implications is a pity.

cqugt2u&TheGirlSurvivalGuide&normalnarmol&I used to get ingrown toenails all the time. The best way I found to deal with them is right after you get out of the shower, clean under the nail really well, then clip it so that there are no sharp edges left. I used a tiny pair of nail scissors that came in a four piece nail set, clippers, metal Emory board, scissors and tweezers. Then if there's still a little edge file it smooth. And then just keep an eye on it. Clean under your toenail regularly to make sure nothing's getting gross. It may sound weird, but you can also sort of clip the skin around the nail bed, like they do in manicures. I don't know what its actually called, but just kind of remove the dead skin and that helps too.

cqugt35&DestinyTheGame&atrich&For people who don't know, the trick to getting max height jumps on titan is just to double tap the jump button. No pause, no delay.

The cut around the head skin deep and deglove the penis of skin then suture the corpus cavernosum (spelling?).  Then they stick drainage tubes in you cock for a few days, complete with a foley catheter for at least 2 weeks while the urethra heals.

cqugt7p&AskReddit&verytinyapple&Not a teacher but my friend got mono and missed most of 7th grade, when she came back she was so behind the teachers had to teach her independently. Me and my other friend would go with her during lunch to her tutoring session with our science teacher just so she wouldn't feel awkward or alone, the tutoring sessions were fun and light hearted so we definitely didn't mind. One day I decided that I wasn't going to go to the lunch session with her because I wanted to go to the field and play with other friends and the teacher told my friends that i was obnoxious, not funny, and that i didn't need to come everyday. It was probably the meanest thing anyone in middle school ever said to me, especially since i considered her a teacher i respected and appreciated since the four of us had a close relationship. then, we see gave us unassigned seats in class the next week so my two best friends sat together in the back and she made me sit up front... I don't understand why she disliked me so much to this day... Why are the adults that act like middle schoolers the ones teaching them?

At 60 Prayer, you get 22 Prayer points per dose of Prayer potion.  With the RotG having a Holy Wrench effect, we'll get 24; each potion (4) is worth 96 Prayer points.

(96 Prayer Points / dose)/(2 Prayer points) is 48 doses; this is 12 Prayer potions.  That's a lot of potions you need to break even!  This is a small buff, honestly; it's probably less than the buff produced by the +3 Prayer bonus in the first place, unless you're at Barrows."

cqugt9k&IAmA&Taiga-Aisaka&"You are right that Cranston said San Fernando Valley.

In other interviews with Vince in the past though, he said it was the Inland Empire, specifically Riverside, California. I used to live close to Riverside and the Inland Empire, and there is a real drug problem out here. I think the show could have been excellent here for that reason (especially since Meth is becoming an epidemic here). HOWEVER, New Mexico gave it a beautiful setting that this area of California is missing (it would have been more Urban like the Wire as opposed to spacial and naturesque).

Also, you couldn't really do the cartel/border plot lines as much (Gus Fring's plot would have been harder to do).  So all in all, it was a blessing that California was too expensive to film. According to Vince, it was the tax breaks that ultimately swayed them to go to New Mexico (although not the only reason. But at the end of the day, money matters when it comes to production. No getting around that). 

I think your assessment is right in that there were probably multiple areas in California they were looking at. Either way, it was too expensive to film in the state. So both of you are right."

I talked with my department chair today a little. He said there's no installed policy. That he thought I could do 1.5 weeks away (unfortunately, I teach 4 days/week instead of two), and that I might not be paid because with their policy, they might need a substitute. I don't think I'd be able to get 2 weeks. 

If he had a smartphone, I'd ask him if something happened to message me immediately so I could try to get out there immediately. 

I felt awful the other day because usually he's on in the morning and I was joking on his FB with a post asking where he was... then he says (hours later) that he was at the hospital. 

I feel like I'm saying/doing everything wrong right now...  :(

Cacique is a US brand, while Curvy Kate, Elomi, etc are UK sized and use a different system. For reference, I wear Panache/ Cleo the most (UK) and wear a 34JJ or a 36J. For US cup sizes that would make me a 36M or 34N.

Prior to coming to this awesome sub, my best fitting bras were actually Cacique...but I was wearing the wrong size. If you haven't already, do check out the sidebar for taking your measurements as that will help guide your selections and any recommendations people make.

cqugtbb&KotakuInAction&dingoperson2&"I'm skeptical of #AntiSJW. Struggle to say exactly why - movements that start with ""Anti-"" just tend to feel more constrained if anything. 

If someone sees ""GamerGate"" they might think.. hm, that's an interesting name, let me check it out.

If they see ""Anti-something"" they might just think.. okay, so they are against something called SJWs, whatever that is. And if they have heard of SJWs they will conclude in their head what it's about, and if they haven't it won't concern them - someone they don't know being anti someone they don't know.

This is also a big step, as SJW ideology is a pretty big thing in the entire Democratic campaign / political left. Hell, even Hillary Clinton would be ranked up there with her recent ""Women are owed money, think of all the stuff you can buy with the money you are owed"" spiel. So you'd be looking to go toe to toe with Hillary from the start.

At the moment the Gamergate tag has given a solid grounding to a general anti-SJW ideology, but one you declare that your primary goal IS to fight SJW ideology, it might seem an overwhelming task to take on. 

Still, not ruling it out, just needs a lot of thinking not to fizzle."

cqugtbu&relationships&sugarpie22&"I am honestly shocked at how harshly people are treating you. There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting your husband to be attracted to you, and not once did you say that was more important to you than your future child or that you thought he'd leave you over it. 

Having not yet been pregnant myself, my best suggestion would be to bring it up with the mindset of once you are pregnant. That is obviously a very emotional time, and I think you should just say you need to get this off your chest now before those emotions confuse the issue further. Stress that you know he is in it for the long haul, as are you, but that you may need extra affection and support should this event arise, rather than just a quick surgery."

You can't just say that a certain group of people can do something, while another can't. It's why the push for marriage equality is so strong.
And on that note, if you tell a same-sex couple they can bypass the law just on a technicality, it would create inequality and be unfair(albeit still wrong by nature) to the conventional couple.

cqugtci&AskReddit&byviolet&that wasn't really what the jane elliot experiment was about, you're probably thinking of the pygmalion study.
cqugtcj&techsupport&bothunter&"Actually, Windows does some very smart things with the swap.  It keeps track of how often pages of memory are accessed, and it will start filling the swap with those pages during idle time long before you hit memory pressure.  Then when you do actually need the memory, Windows can just clear the page in memory without worrying about writing it to disk, resulting in a much more responsive system.  This is just one of the myriad tricks that pretty much any modern OS will do.

Windows will also keep track of what files are frequently accessed and try to keep those in memory.  It may even trade off that by swapping infrequently used memory pages to swap.  The results of these tricks will show that Windows is using just about all of your memory(which is a good thing.. unused memory is just a waste of money) and a fairly high swap usage(again, unless you're constantly waiting on disk I/O, then there really isn't a huge problem)"

cqugtdw&mazda&houtaru&"I have driven both (GT versions).  Both cars drove like a dream.  

The 2016 is a little quieter, but not by much.  The engine seems a bit louder in the 2016 when pushed.  I liked that about the new car.

The interior is better in the 2016.  The screen is clearer and bigger, and is set higher so the driver can see it.  The interior felt more upscale as well - a bit more aesthetically pleasing than the older model.  I would say it's leagues better than the competition (Accord, Fusion, Camry)  

Are those items worth the 3-5K on a touring?  I'd say its worth maybe 3, but no more.  That's just my subjective opinion because I greatly value the tech and interior in a new car.  "
cqugtdx&falcons&TheDuke4&Langford and Allen are good picks and honestly the Gurley vibe is mostly wishful thinking from a UGA alum. During his tenure at UGA, Gurley was picking up a ton of carries. Mike Bobo was handing him the ball like nobody's business because he was the greatest back in the NCAA. He had 1 ankle injury other than his ACL tear, but I think that had a lot to do with his carry rate and the fact he is/was a young player trying to put himself out there for his team. Lets keep in mind he was starting over Chubb, Marshall, and Michel. All 3 are RBs everyone wants and honestly Nick Chubb may be just a damn good (let's look for him in the near future). I'm not too concerned over his knee injury to think that he is just going to tear it again. He has such an impressive carry style and downhill run I think he is going to tear it up this year wherever he lands. I think he has the opportunity to be the next Marshawn Lynch if he stays healthy. He is THAT explosive. All personal opinion of course. Fire away Redditors.

cqugtf5&leagueoflegends&kelustu&"With a small sample size and a biased response group. If you take Stats 101 the first thing you learn is to decide how a certain type of poll may present non-representative answers. For example, if you do a landline survey, you're not going to get many young respondents. Same for physical mail.

If you give out a survey, the people that answer are likely ones that are more involved in the game and scene. It's not unreasonable to assume that a large portion of people don't care to answer polls, especially for things that may never become part of the game, but they also care enough about things once they become reality.

cqugtf7&Hemophilia&imarcink&"They're starting to use Python in a lot of highschool programs, from what I can tell.  My best friend learned C when he was your age!  C is very low-level compared to Python.

Decades ago, 13 year olds were building computers out of vacuum tubes and wires :)

Don't underestimate yourself!  I started making websites when I was around your age and uploading them to Linux servers run by other guys my age.  The skills you develop by learning programming in your teen years will be a source of so much fun later in life.

Python can also be used in robotics projects!  If your family can afford it, maybe see about getting a Raspberry Pi and some robotics parts.  there are a lot of amazing things you can do with a Raspberry Pi!  it runs Linux and you can attach all kinds of sensors to it.  I want to make a humidity sensor for my guitars that sends me an email if the humidity is too high or too low. :P

Forcing myself to do things I'm not very interested in at that moment doesn't work. If I wait a bit until I feel eager to continue, it goes a lot easier.

And with feeling interested I don't mean 'I want to do that'. It means wanting to do something, and making time for it.

cqugthx&AdviceAnimals&BaronVonWaffle&"Story:

While entering an aisle at the grocery store tonight, a mother and her two sons were further down the aisle. The children were about 7 and 13, following their mom and behaving fairly well, with the older one pushing the cart. As they were walking, a box of macaroni and cheese fell off the shelves about 2 feet behind the younger kid. The box probably had been balancing on the edge for awhile, and just fell, and the younger kid happened to be in the wrong place and the wrong time.

The mother, turned around and began slapping her child with very fast smacks to the cheek, along with ""Why don't you behave yourself? What have I told you about keeping your hands to yourself?"", and finished with a spank. The kid was obviously in pain, but didn't want to cry and further bring embarrassment to himself. 

I moved to pick up the box while the mother was moving along and disciplining her kid (didn't bother to pick up the box her son ""knocked off""), and the elder son had done the same thing. I told the elder son that his brother hadn't done anything and the box had just fallen.

A few seconds later, the mother looked back down the aisle at me and just gave a shrug, then a hurried her children down the next aisle."

cqugtj0&religion&hakeliyah&"Hi,

Please read the Torah so you don't say weird things. Stop reading Wikis and read the actual Torah, please. The torah says CLEARLY that YHWH made a covenant with Abraham. MORE THAN ONCE:

Gen 12:17-18: ""{17} And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, [...] {18} In the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land [...]""

Exodus 2:17: ""And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.""

Leviticus 26:42: ""Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.""

I am not going to read your Wiki. I have studied the Torah. I did not read a Wiki and think I know everything like you did. Sit down and study the Torah please. If you are claiming to be a Messianic Jew, than you know that your duty to study Torah is outlined multiple times in the Torah and the Prophets (Deuteronomy 6, Joshua 1, etc).

If possible, please don't waste my time with further uninformed responses. I am trying to speak to the Original Poster of this thread."

I have bought all my cars new, never had a car older than 8 years or 100K miles.  Nearing $1M net worth this year.  

It is not about what you choose to drive, but about accumulating wealth.  You have to figure out how to accumulate somehow, and for most people that means saving money from your paycheck to invest.  Once the investments get large enough then simply not touching them is all that matters (i.e. they grow faster than you contribute).  Finally, you reach the point where that growth is large enough you can draw a nice amount from the total and it still grows.

I personally like cars so this is something I spend money on.  For others that just need A to B transportation this is an area where they can save money.

cqugtnh&ClickerHeroes&Nosfrat&"I don't know, I never understood why people did that. Every hero's base DPS is based on their cost, but with a penalty based on their ""slot"", so every hero has lower base DPS per cost than the previous one due to that penalty.

Following that logic, you'd be better off using whichever hero will get the closest to 4100 by the time you ascend, with the higher base DPS and higher amount of x4 (and x10) multipliers.

Now obviously if you're going for a super deep run to 4K+ you're gonna want to use Astraea, but... well, I don't know. I just don't know the math behind it. I'd say regild Astraea if you're going for a very deep run (several days), but if you just want to increase your current highest by a couple hundred, which hero you use probably won't make much of a difference."

I saw them in my own town and I personally would never visit a demo with such a far right presence. It's important to remember that it was middle class ""concerned citizens"" who actually voted the Nazis to power. Not everyone was Waffen SS.

I mainly find that I'd like to have a forum for discussion on Europe here on Reddit for actual normal European, we don't need these crazy types.

I think it's easily justifiable to want a longer cooldown on this summoner spell. It fits in ARAM and I think it's good that melee champions are given more power with it. It's incredible strong as it is though."

We decided to do it, in part to get ahead of the 4/20 weekend. But now we've got a short wait for accessories. 

We do have a small amount of accessories on hand here - Ojan is your man for those if you are in a pinch. Otherwise the accessories should be up shortly on our web site. Thanks for your patience!

cqugtu8&malefashionadvice&rulla101&"Many of the clothes you have are wearable, don't get me wrong. However, most of them wouldn't work too well together, so you risk looking a bit tacky. That's not even taking into account how well they fit; I'm assuming that if you've dropped some body fat those clothes won't fit right (although, given the first image, they probably didn't fit right before).

However, all that is fine. What really matters is that you're motivated now to learn how to dress well, and to avoid stuff like the first image. Right now, you should focus on strengthening the basics. You're doing pretty well already on shorts, shoes, and those basic tees, so what you need to do is **read the sidebar guides and the wiki** and take in the information that the community has laid out regarding fit and style. Once you've been acquainted with that, it'll influence your clothing choices and future purchases. It just takes some time.

You'll make some mistakes, but it gets better if you stay motivated. And if you reeeally don't have any idea what to do, there's always [this.](http://i.imgur.com/Vkz1ir7.jpg)

You also only pay taxes on the earnings so if you are paying the 15% long term capital gains tax or getting qualified dividends you only need to have made 1.725% before selling out to hit 1.5% return after taxes.  Buy some [10 Year US Federal bonds](http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us/), they have a yield of 2.03%(4/30/15) which gives you a yield of 1.726% after taxes.

cqugtut&nfl&jellatubbies&Bucs and Winston were built for each other. Irrelevant player for an irrelevant team. A match made in heaven.
cqugtuu&soccer&Regents_Park&"Bale scored freakish individual goals to win trophies. He scored amazing individual goals match after match to win games for SPurs that led to his transfer fee. The last 4 years he's had 20, 25, 28 and 20 this season goals and assists. 

Pogba has had a few great long shots and performances but he hasn't consistently won matches for Juve, he hasn't consistently scored last minute winners, he hasn't won trophies due to his individual brilliance, he hasn't even had one season of great end product despite playing as the most attacking midfielder let alone 4 years of consistent end product. 

DOn't get me wrong, I rate Pogba highly but you can see why his valuation is significantly lower than Bale.

Add in the marketability of Bale being British, the world record fee and being able to take him off RM and you can see how his transfer fee balloons. 

From a purely footballing perspective though I think Pogba has a higher ceiling than Veratti but Veratti has no weaknesses or consistency issues whereas Pogba has clear deficiencies and consistency issues. At his worst Veratti is still useful, at his worst Pogba is frustrating. Though considering his outrageous talent Pogba can play atrocious all match and pull out a moment of genius in a way Veratti can't so if you're more risk taking in your managerial approach I can definitely see why you'd prefer Pogba. Plus as he gets more experienced his consistency, maturity, tactical ability, intelligence etc. will all improve so it's freakish to think how good he could become. "

cqugtz7&politics&SporkOfThor&"""Unfortunately, House Republicans refused to give the Senate bill an up-or-down vote.

That’s why the President took action to fix as much of the broken system as he could through his immigration accountability executive actions. These actions will help secure the border, prioritize felons, not families, and hold undocumented immigrants accountable by requiring them to pass a criminal background check and pay their fair share of taxes, and modernizes the legal immigration system. These are common-sense steps, but only Congress can finish the job.

Three critical elements of the President's executive actions are:

    Cracking Down on Illegal Immigration at the Border: The President’s actions increase the chances that anyone attempting to cross the border illegally will be caught and sent back. Continuing the surge of resources that effectively reduced the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border illegally this summer, the President’s actions will also centralize border security command-and-control to continue to crack down on illegal immigration.
    Deporting Felons, Not Families: The President’s actions focus on the deportation of people who threaten national security and public safety. He has directed immigration enforcement to place anyone suspected of terrorism, violent criminals, gang members, and recent border crossers at the top of the deportation priority list.
    Accountability – Criminal Background Checks and Taxes: The President is also acting to hold accountable those undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for more than five years and are parents of U.S. citizens or Lawful Permanent Residents. By registering and passing criminal and national security background checks, millions of undocumented immigrants will start paying their fair share of taxes and temporarily stay in the U.S. without fear of deportation for three years at a time.

The President’s actions will also streamline legal immigration to boost our economy and will promote naturalization for those who qualify.""

So, yeah, he's working on it, after giving Congress lots of room to do it themselves.  Now Congress is demanding Obama stop working on it, which you should also feel free to complain about - oh, you already did.

cqugu23&SVExchange&roxas982&Always happy to help
cqugu24&INTP&seaofchel&"As far back as I can remember I've always had a thing for space. I remember seeing the pillars of creation in a school book back in the 90s and just being awestruck. The first time I saw the youtube video of the picture of Andromeda I actually cried a little...but in a tough intimidating way. 8-) Which other than physical pain I really don't cry all that often. Certainly don't get moved to tears by things so it shows just how much that effected me. I've had a lot of other interests and have always spent a lot of time dwelling on philosophy/ethics (it wasn't until this last year though that I started reading/listening to the more well known philosophical writings). Actually pretty much everything on your list besides alchemy are things I've spent a lot of time with. 

Dark matter used to be what I sat and thought about all the time, but I've come to the conclusion that it is a) likely to be more than one thing (I think the filament like structures and the blobs are probably different things but HEY what do I know, yet.) and b) probably not as exciting as other areas of interest might be. Which has me focusing more on quantum mechanics. I think the answers and connections that I am looking for between all of my musings and observations and stuff might be found there, and if not well it's certainly very interesting. 

As a side thought, have you noticed how ""as above so below"" seems to ring true in our universe? For example, the shape of the universe reminds me a lot of neuro pathways. Which lends nicely to the (novel?) idea of ""the universe is a consciousness experiencing itself"" that I like to toy with sometimes. It's fun to bring that back to this age old notion of there being a God. Every civilization (that I can think off of the top of my head) has this idea of there being god(s) or some sort of force. Is God merely the Universe sitting and thinking? Probably not but fun to think about, especially to push the boundaries of what constitutes ""life"". What if we are all little components inside some elaborate thought experiment? 

I also spend a lot of time thinking about social issues and problems in the systems we use here in the state. Our social aid programs are atrocious and generally set up in a way to keep people trapped in the cycle of poverty rather than be stepping stones out of it. I hope to one day be a part of fixing/rebuilding that and/or some of the other flawed systems and such (for example public education, healthcare, the treatment of mental health, wrecking the environment etc) we have going on so I can stop worrying about their effects so much."
cqugu25&atheism&YourFairyGodmother&"Heh.  Voting out GO Prick Santorum (ever see that bumper sticker? Friend of mine made those) was one of the last things I got to do in PA before moving out of state.  I'm actually a native Pennyslavian - PSU alum and all that. 

FWIW I moved from PA to deep blue Oregon and only recently moved to Texas, a return to the state I previously lived in about thirty five years ago.  Some things never change, I can confirm.  Texas is amazingly chock-full of fucking redneck Tealibangicals.  Five, ten years maybe some statewide offices - Gov., Senator, _could_ go Dem but the Texas state house will forever be a den of mouth breathing morons. "

Farmables in that case leave you with [Dark Twin Star Tiamat](http://www.puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=1111), [Helldark Blood Demon](http://www.puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=479), and [Underworld Guard Dog, Cerberus](http://www.puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=1214), and [Moonbeam Fang Witch, Lilith](http://www.puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=1105). I'd personally disregard the demon since its stats are abysmal. Lilith might be pretty good in some situations where you need a poison but her devil enhance won't do much for you with a farmable team. So now you've got a base of DMeta/DD Tiamat/Cerberus/x/x/DMeta. Before adding in anything else, this team has 7 Dark Rows and 8 Skill Boosts. Pretty good. For those other two slots at least one of them should really be a [Vampire](http://www.puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=894), max skilled if possible. He won't get the bonus from DMeta but you really need to keep those Dark orbs coming since DMeta's a row based team. To that end it would probably be a good idea to have your last slot be a skilled [Voice](http://www.puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=826)

So your team would look like this DMeta/DD Tiamat/Cerberus/CDKV/DB Vampire/DMeta. It's not pretty, it's by no means super good. But you have 7 rows, Tiamat's enhance and the orb enhances from Cerberus and the DMetas themselves so you should be able to pull some decent damage. But it requires a ton of special materials.

It won't get you through anything terribly hard, and I probably wouldn't recommend you put too much energy into this team. Definitely level her though, at worst you can put her as your dark slot on Horus as an unbindable stat stick with 3 skill boosts. Look out for her usual suspects in the REM obviously. Haku, Hanzo, Gryps Rider, Pandora. 

Side note though. If you do end up getting a Haku. Once you're able to do the coin dungeons get yourself a couple [Vibrant Butterfly Dragon, Swallowtail](http://www.puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=1601) and max skill a [Hamahime](http://www.puzzledragonx.com/en/monster.asp?n=718) through Watery Temptress. 

DMeta/DD Haku/Hamahime/Swallowtail/Swallowtail/DMeta is what I used to no brain clear Friday Mythical all the way up to when I rolled my first actual Hanzo.

cqugu7g&nfl&God_Wills_It_&There is only so many ways the commentators can say the same things about the hundreds of prospects without it sounding super racist/like a slave market.  Pedigree is one of those words that has a good connotation so they can use it.  
cqugu7h&survivor&shutupredneckman&"Both tribes were out of rice. The comparison is even better in that the Barramundis just ate too much, whereas half of the NuHunahpus had literally nothing to do with being out of rice since they had just been swapped into the tribe. 

Craft is artistic intent, the way the story is constructed with tools like foreshadowing, easter eggs, irony, etc. It's the same as with a physical structure like a marble statue. An artist with true craftsmanship can add a bunch of details that a layman wouldn't be able to do in marble. Similarly SJDS has a bunch of compelling stories that weave through each other to make a tapestry, whereas this season has characters that have not been crafted for anything. Nina is the only person whose story really led somewhere. Shirin was a crafted character that didn't get any of the closure her story deserved. The others are without craft, and their stories are just ""here's a person, here's how they are, here's their finish"". 

Shit. In SJDS, even someone as low key as *Alec* had a compelling story of growing from someone who was petty and jealous toward his older brother Drew, and who let that enter into his dealings with people like Baylor, to someone who was alone at final 7 with a bunch of loved one pairs and realized that he missed Drew and wished he was there. Alec was a total douchebag and very sparse on confessionals/airtime, and yet the editors were able to craft a story for him that made him human and gave him closure. And they did that with like 17 other people too. Which is all to say we should not have someone in this game like Tyler or Dan who we know literally nothing about aside from that their boringly awful and awfully awful respectively. They have no growth, no arc, not even hope for a villainous downfall now that Shirin is gone. There's no craft to their stories, just basic ignoring and mocking, respectively."

Preference: Out of box, but am flexible

Reason: Kirby and the Amazing Mirror was my first ever video game, and ever since then I've loved everything about it. When I first saw Meta Knight, my little mind couldn't believe there was a Kirby that was also really cool and edgy, I loved him so much. So when he was revealed in Brawl, I played him ALL the time. To a bunch of kids it doesn't matter a players power level, we didn't know what OP was, we thought Samus was the strongest. Eventually we got better and more serious, I got banned from using him in Brawl, but now I play him all the time in PM and 4. His quick and clean playstyle is so much fun, and I've made high place in many local tournaments with him. I'm always going to love my angry little strawberry (my nickname for him, and what I'd love to name the Amiibo), so it kills me to be unable to find him easily.

Project Description:
Students will have the ability to create what they want for a final project. It should encompass most of what you have learned through out the semester. For full credit on the Final Project, students must go beyond what they have learned in the class. Short 2–5 minute action films, a series of commercials, web videos, and network promos are examples of acceptable final projects. Students without an idea for a final project will be assigned a branding/promotion project for WUFT-TV or WUFT-FM.

cquguc9&physicianassistant&airbornemint&"I can't answer your exact question, because I am not a practicing PA/MPH yet — I am just starting school this fall.

However, I can tell you a bit about my reasoning for going into the dual program. The way I see it, every question in healthcare is deeply connected to public health. You don't get to choose whether that connection exists; you only get to choose how aware of it and educated about it you are going to be. Because of that, and because of the role PAs play in both longitudinal healthcare of individual patients and cross-sectional health of patient populations, I see understanding of public health as an important component of being a good PA.

That said, most PA practice settings in no direct way take advantage of the PA's PH training and experience. If you want to take advantage of your PH training as a PA, you have to explicitly seek out employers and opportunities that take advantage of them. For example, if you are a PA with PH focused on policy, you can reasonably expect better access to certain types of leadership and administration opportunities than if you were a PA without PH. The types of opportunities that open up are going to be very much dependent on what your PH focus is; biostatistics PH dovetails with research, chronic disease epidemiology dovetails with primary practice and community health, etc.

One way you may want to think about it is this: if the kind of PA practice that you envision yourself in will involve ongoing collaboration with PH professionals, then it's likely that such practice would be able to take advantage of a PA/MPH. Otherwise, odds are that MPH would be personally beneficial and make you a more informed provider, but not much beyond that; whether that's enough of an incentive is up to you."

Por eso cambian las encuestas a gusto del que quieren hacer propaganda. Según muchas encuestas (por ejemplo la publicada por ""El País"", que se ganó la crítica de todos) el primer Partido Político en voto directo sería PODEMOS. Aunque en Andalucía se demostró que no era así, que los ""cocineros"" habían hecho muy bien su trabajo... propagandístico. Y ahora los resultados de Andalucía y la ineficacia en poder influir en la formación de gobierno autónomo, la participación en el mismo o la implantación de parte del programa electroal de PODEMOS suponen una propaganda negativa que va a pesar como una losa.

cqugueq&magick&Kleindolph&"Alright, I have never interviewed someone before, nor do I have any real reporter skills. So here is my best shot at transcribing my mother's story of her time at the Lucis Trust.

While my mother was in London, one of her friend's mother was murdered. This friend was looking for spiritual help, and was referred to the Lucis Trust. This friend, knowing my mother was into the occult, gave the address to my mother, telling her to check out the library.

My mother drove to the address, which ended up being the United Nations building. My mother found the library, looked at a few books, and found almost all of them to be about Kabbalistic Mysticism or be by Alice Bailey or Benjamin Creme, or Demonology and summoning techniques. 

Apparently the Lucis Trust has an Arcane School, in which the curriculum is composed of mostly Alice Bailey books, and to apply you must have read some of her work. The books written by Alice Bailey, are written by a Demon that she allows to possess her often(my mother states that this is mentioned in one of Alice Baileys books, I have no other source for this story).

Within the library my mother also found very thick, very hefty books that were not allowed to be checked out. Within these books were plans and projects from as far back as the 1400s depicting where Famine, War, Poverty, etc were to be held and by whom affecting whom. These dates and plans covered everything up to 2060, so far, by my mother's claim, they have been accurate to the letter. The only reason I have faith in this claim is the fact that she told me that their would be a massive drought in California a full 5 years before it occured, and that a famine was planned for California for 2017. 

On top of all this, the World Health Organization is(was?) also housed within the UN building in London, and so is a ""Gentleman's club""(Men only surprisingly) for the British Royal Family is housed in this building as well.

Among other things, Agenda 21 is supposedly something they are going to implement. Something about depopulation and using technology to keep themselves immortal :/ I imagine they are funding heavily any company that does research into such technology.

I don't want to get into it, but apparently this 'Core Organization' is also playing the World Bank.

**TL;DR** - World is owned by a Demonic Cult that's basis is within the UN and Lucis Trust with ties to British Royalty, the World Bank, and the World Health Organization.

Sounds nutty, but a lot of it is kinda on their website. They aren't trying to be secretive or anything. One of the things that you can look up is a book called 'Reappearance of Christ and the Masters of Wisdom' by Benjamin Creme(I think that's how you spell it). Benji is all about faking that reappearance of Christ through a guy he is supporting called Maitreya, who he has been touring around the world with. I can't make this stuff up :)

cqugufh&justneckbeardthings&Geodude07&"For a lot of them I imagine it's a misplaced feeling of lust that comes from having no other females in their life to feel attachment for.

It leads them to think 'Well these are some good natured characters, I bet they would like me for who I am!"". This then eventually leads to feeling of love and eventually sexuality.

I think they are self aware, I just think they have so little else going for them that they have to hide in these fantasies. They seem to think real life women won't be as kind as their ponies."

cqugufx&AskReddit&Gunter_Penguin&"CNN isn't the liberal counterpart to Fox News. CNN is mostly just an incredibly incompetent joke, which can't be taken seriously. It's barely even news. MSNBC is the liberal counterpart. However, Fox is a much larger news organization (most-watched in America), and the vast majority of its programming is opinion shows being passed off as news programs.

The combination of Fox's popularity and extremely rightwing opinion shows results in it being attacked much more often. MSNBC has the same tendency to go off the rails on the liberal side of things, but fewer people see it."

However, I somehow ended up at the store I play at now, and actually ended up running the events after the original judge had to move away. Everyone is there to have fun, and everyone is accommodating of new players.

I recommend trying Meetup.com, searching your area, and looking for a place with relatively casual players. I've played for over 15 years and know the game inside and out, but even *I* hate playing with the ultra-competitive douches."

cqugug8&hearthstone&ApexHawke&"Posting decklists is more fruitful than askin for ""general tips"". If you just hear ""play a good curve"" or ""Play card A, card B is also good"", then there's lots of ways for a guy to misunderstand that advice and still keep playing in a suboptimal way. So much about this game is situational, that asking for help with a specific deck gives you just better results than trying to implement advice from a short-ish comment.

I will say though, that copying decks with Naxx cards, and then replacing the naxx cards will probably result in shittier decks. Building decks from the ground up without Naxx cards, will result in better ones. 

Good archetype without any Naxx cards would be ramp Druid, which only plays the Loatheb, a very replaceable card in general. "

It needs to be flawless or else you're giving a human something not true to nature, and many people can't adapt their sense of direction to it. This is why maps exist in games with so much detail, because in reality you can get a much stronger sense of where you are, where you came from, and where you're going. Games - especially Morrowind with its limited graphics - do not have you so in tune. Some adapt well but it's not exactly a hyper minority that doesn't.

We shouldn't just say ""Fuck you"" to those who can't handle it. Hell, my mom can't handle real life directions, let alone games. I just think there should be both options in games, which leaves room for error in the directions and leaves room for gamers who don't want their hands held."

In my opinion, the top four teams consist of avant in 1st, then 3 teams tied for a close second, and I have the proof you seem to demand. In our scrims against tkam, we +exhil) generally manage a close win. Tkam have the same situation against slap. As in tkam are beating slap. But when wexhil scrim slap, slap generally win. This weird 3 way tie is something that frustrates our team when people leave us out. All teams have worked hard for their placings. There have been multiple times where our team has been left out of top teams discussion, and as you can imagine its kinda annoying.

cqugui3&nutaku&ButIAmInsane&"Here's hoping you didn't waste your free silvers on cost reduction, or else it is a bit dire from first glance as you now lack the units to CC your healers. 

To do Ryujin King which is a big hurdle you need at least 1, if not 2 CC healers to provide safe clear. It is not just because of how much heal you get but also for the necessary range to make it work so your range damage units don't get blown up by their AOE. You have a Princess so that could settle your tank problem but I would put the bet that the biggest reason you are struggling now is on your healing department and a generally low damage output.

At this point if you lack healers to CC your only hope is to go with tank swaps period. Because there is literally no way to tank 2 mages effectively without a healer to come by you can try splitting by tanking both on 2 separate lanes. "

Thus it laughs at your attempts to give it motion and gives you motion instead.

If your chair were rooted to the floor and you did the same thing with all your force, you'd probably move the desk instead. Unless it's one of those big solid wood desks or a steelcase or something. Then you'd need Arnold Schwarzenegger arms and a competition to see whether your chair legs snap or the desk moves first would ensue among a lot of grunting."

cqugujw&TumblrInAction&GodOfThunder44&"Relevant story. A guy who until just recently worked under me was allegedly (I say allegedly because this situation cannot be confirmed either way, however he is a really good guy and I personally feel that it is mostly likely to be true in terms of the actual events, if not the specifics) assaulted by his wife.

He was holding his 4 month old son and ended up getting into an argument with his wife over money (he is the sole provider of the household). It got heated, and she started hitting and biting him while he was holding his child. He, in his words, ""just snapped,"" and elbowed her in the face. 

He set his child down and left the house to cool down. Called me directly afterwards and told me what (allegedly) happened. I told him to file a police report for assault, even if he decided not to press charges. He did so, but when he got back to his house he found his wife had called the cops first, and he was arrested.

He now has pending domestic abuse charges."

cquguk8&NoStupidQuestions&FUZxxl&"There are multiple ways to store a “secret” track, but the following method is what is traditionally used.

See, an audio CD internally works a little bit like an old-fashioned record. There's a continuous stream of audio with a little table of contents up front. This table of contents contains entries for up to 99 songs. It stores a) at what time the song begins b) how long the song is. When you select a song, the disc drive moves the laser to roughly where the song is supposed to start and waits for a certain signal stored in the subchannel data (additional data stored along with the audio). Once it sees the signal, it waits until the signal is gone and then starts playing audio. This mechanism is needed because seeking on CD drives used to be somewhat inaccurate, which is why it could take up to 2 seconds for the drive to find the right spot.

Now, there is no reason why the first song needs to start at second 0. On some discs, the first song starts at a later time, for instance at second 120. A CD drive is dumb, it doesn't recognize that there is something off about the first song. It just seeks to 120 seconds and starts playing music. To hear the audio before the first track, you need to select track one, and then seek backwards. Most CD players happily oblige and seek without checking for boundaries. Some modern, “smart” players might refuse though.

A good CD ripping program (like `readcd` from the [cdrtools](http://cdrecord.org) distribution) should be capable of detecting a hidden track like this one and rips it as well."

What you do is **unlock** the bootloader, as in saying; ""Yes, I'm a responsible human being that needs no handholding and know my way around this"". Also root is nothing more than giving you ""admin rights"" on the system, so ye, obviously any version can get root. It's no ""hack"", because (largely) it needs nothing to be hacked for like jailbreaking an iOS device. (Someone needs to find an exploit to actually be able to, which is actually hacking it, and apple tries to prevent that at all cost at every new iteration, whereas Nexus devices are developers devices which grant you this freedom from the manufacturer)."

cquguot&funny&h_lance&"I love pathology.  The hardest part of becoming a pathologist is getting in to medical school, that's absolutely for sure.  If you're determined, repeat application is actually a good strategy.   DO candidates can usually get a solid pathology residency, by the way.

If you go to medical school, judge specialties on these factors before choosing one - I put one to three plus signs according to how good pathology is in each category - 

1) Inherent interest - +++, extremely interesting

2) Income - ++, around average 

3) Amount of call during training - +++, very mild.  I wouldn't call a path residency a ""great lifestyle"" - lots of hard work and reading - but you can usually go home after work.

4) Hours and call after training - On average ++, there are easier and harder jobs.  To make in academics you have to work hard.

5) Live wherever you want - +, there are not that many pathologists in the world.  I'm in the suburbs of a great city.  The specialties that might allow you to live in some beach or mountain or college small town paradise are pretty much family practice, pediatrics, and maybe general internal medicine or emergency medicine.  Pathologists are mainly concentrated in densely populated areas, typically in cities and suburbs.  If you work hard and stay positive in your residency or fellowship you can usually get a job in the general area.  I would say it's decently easy to be in the New York or Chicago area; in fact I just finished a fellowship in the Chicago area and found a job here.  LA I don't really know.  San Francisco or Portland OR might be tricky - super popular without a lot of pathology programs.  Seattle I'm not sure.  Other areas are fairly obtainable but it's a good idea to train where you want to settle down, if you know that.

There's a lot of obsession about reimbursement changes in medicine these days, but it will still be a great job in the future."

You know, like when a black guy is called a thug for not actually doing anything that's actually ""thuggish"" or doing something a white guy would do who isn't typically called the same word.

And of course they know this; I don't believe they're so stupid that the basics of context escape them. That some white guy with a swastika tattoo shouting ""Sieg heil"" isn't actually doing anything wrong because neither of those actions are ""naturally offensive"" and ""you could make anything seem offensive"". They just play stupid, like a child, because that's the easy, safe route.

cquguqy&hiphopheads&Doc_Strangelove&"I could find more specific examples if you'd like, but the first one someone would notice would be the first track on the album, ""Treat Her Like a Prostitute"". It sounds like Rick may have had some heartbreak, but that doesn't make treating every woman like a prostitute acceptable.

I could definitely see how, this album being your intro to rap, you would have a soft spot for it, and it would stick in your memory pretty easily. It's not as if I hate the album, and I have a lot of respect for Rick and what he did for hip-hop. I just disagree with a lot of the content. As for why the sound doesn't stick out to me as one of the best is probably  because a lot of rappers that came after him emulated a lot of what he did, and that sound eventually split into a lot of different sounds, each of which may still be being perfected today. Not many people read Shakespeare on the daily for fun, but he's present in all modern literature, just like Rick and other early hip-hop pioneers are found in all modern hip-hop.

cqugur6&MensRights&Hanshen&"A 'meaningful' definition, or any definition that I know of, of intelligence does not include a hypothesis that people 'in the UK' are less intelligent... Which was never the thesis anyway. I don't really understand your sporadic argument here. 

Anyway, seeing as you asked. 

Just for a change, can you provide me with some sources that illustrate that people living in biblical times (so post Athenian democracy etc.) were 'less intelligent'. I don't mean unrelated arguments relating to religion or violence, they are totally irrelevant obviously. I mean some biological argument that our ancestors from the time of the bible are less intelligent (see my previous post for a broad definition, but you can pick and chose any one tbh. They all pertain to human cognitive capacities anyway. Not learning or education as you seem to believe).  

https://osswiata.pl/kasprzak/files/2013/02/crabtree-2.pdf

That's besides the point though. My argument is that our ancestors were unlikely to be LESS intelligent than us. It depends which evolutionary biologist you listen to, and what was the environmental queue that triggered brain development. Either way brain size and intelligence was WELL established by the time of the bible. 

I mean, let's put it another way for you. Do you believe that there has been a genuine increase in intelligence over the last 50 years? Was your grandfather significantly more stupid than you? I doubt it. Yet society and learning has increased dramatically since his time. Similarly, do you envisage that your grandchildren will be significantly more intelligent than you? Obviously that's ridiculous. Why would it be any different in 100 years? Or 200? Or indeed 1000? Have our brains grown in size? Have we biologically changed? Are we a different species?

cqugure&FanTheories&onemanutopia&Generally, I hate it when the ending of a movie is intentionally left open to interpretation and people try really hard to decode it. If they wanted you to know for sure what happened, they would have shown it. The film works both ways, so just accept that the uncertainty you feel at the end is probably what they intended. Specifically, I hate about 90% of 'Inception' fan theories. The top spins for an improbably (but not impossibly) long time before it wobbles, then cut to black. He doesn't find out for sure if he's actually awake, and neither does the audience, and that's the point. 
cqugurf&serialpodcast&badgreta33&Yes, I agree there would have to be a lot of coincidences. I keep wondering if Jay had nothing to do with it at all, but knew someone who told him something; just like someone may have told Mr. S something. You know, just enough information for him to start inserting himself or Adnan in a narrative for attention that got out of control. I also wonder about Jay's friends from the mosque, the ones who seemed to have resentment towards Adnan, and one of whom may have made the anonymous tip. Maybe they thought they could mess with Adnan/ teach him a lesson, also get the reward money and think no one would really end up in jail? Jay lies, but he doesn't strike me as a murderer any more than Adnan does. I find it so hard to believe he would help bury a body and be able to live with the guilt of it for weeks on end. It just doesn't add up (for me anyway). I also keep coming back to the witness who reported seeing a suspicious person near the concrete barricades at Leakin Park whose report was dismissed by the cops. I'm not saying that was Jay, and Adnan doesn't fit the description, so it begs the question of an unknown third party who may have had a big mouth.

cqugusr&talesfromcallcenters&rpgmaster1532&"The call center I've worked for in the past was auto incoming unless you were in AUX or after-call (ACW). If you were Available, you got an incoming call if you were at the top of the queue. Here's how to handle it, from my point of view.

1. If you leave your desk at all, make sure your phone is in either AUX or ACW. If you haven't been given instructions on how to do this, ask your supervisor and have them give you a walkthrough.

2. When you're in the middle of a call, especially if there is a queue, hit your ACW button if you know you're going to need a few to either take a breath or finish notating the account.

Generally, any time you have an active call on the line your ACW status should be lit, which means it switches to that instead of available, and if you leave your desk for any reason that doesn't require a logout, you use AUX. Some call centers have designated AUX modes, some don't.

YMMV with this advice, but first and foremost, ask your sup if you have ""After Call"" and ""Aux Mode"" on your phones to utilize."

It looks like the PercentageController script tracks when you hit 100%, then loads a bunch of resources, including UFO.  However, as I comb through this code, I'm REALLY, really starting to believe that these UFOs are all we are to find.  UFO triggers two ambient UFOs (the fort one and hippie camp), and starts the UFO_EYE script.  UFO_EYE is separate because it has the other conditions to unlock the model (the location, time, weather, etc).  

However, none of these are showing any interaction code.  And none reference the underwater UFO, as it is just a landmark.  So I think the mural really is just conveying that at 100%, you can find an ambient UFO above the hippie camp (the left icon of the UFO), at the fort (the jetpack icon as the jetpack is found at the fort in the previous game), and the NON ambient UFO (represented by the TRAIL icon...not egg) leading to the top of the mountain.  The outside graphics represent the conditions that need to be met (lightning).

Very discouraging... "

 2) Are you enjoying making Mike a protagonist in Better Call Saul versus somebody working against the interests of the main character in Breaking Bad? "

cquguvj&videos&aimforthehead90&"That's an incredibly vague way to push the blame of homelessness onto millions of people who have absolutely no control over the life choices people make.

A few things to consider:

The number one cause of homelessness is substance abuse, do you have any clue how much money already goes into anti-drug campaigns and addiction recovery programs? To give you an idea, between 2009-2012 over 30 billion was spent on it. I'm not even talking the total costs of the war on drugs as a whole (prison costs, which I am 100% against). 

The fact is, society is spending billions trying to get people to stop taking drugs, offering them support for getting off drugs and awareness programs to get them from getting on drugs in the first place. What more would you like us to do then? Just accept that it's *my* fault that some dude in some alley decided to shoot up and ruin his life? If anything, you can say this is a *family* problem.

In fairness, mental disabilities (schizophrenia) are probably equally a cause of homelessness, and I would agree that we don't do enough for people who suffer from those "

cquguvw&todayilearned&calculon000&"I think it's pretty simple, people have the same attitude toward overweight people as they do toward addicts. They view them as being weak-willed and weak of character, and this reaction becomes especially pronounced when they do encounter fat people who are appearing to evade all personal responsibility for their physical state by trying to put more or less all the blame on someone or something else.

Then, through the power of stereotyping, they start seeing/assuming this attitude in all overweight people. 

In my opinion, there are overweight people who do evade personal responsibility for their weight, and do act entitled by demanding they be considered attractive when, to most, they simply aren't, and have accommodations made for them in cases of morbid obesity. (Like taking up more than one airplane seat, as an example.)

Then there's some people who find it easy to just laugh at people who are different.

TLDR; The difference is that you can't help being old, gay, or of a certain race, but you can help being overweight."

cquguwj&makinghiphop&throwawayshitbars&"Damn man, thanks for really taking a deep listen to this. (this is about to be a huge wall of text).


I wasn't necessarily talking about suicide with the fold my hand bar. I'm more or less saying I'm working towards something that isn't promised. I feel everyone has their own calling, and there's one true passion everyone has, but for a lot of people it's unlikely they'll live off their passion/calling in life (which I was comparing that to the Royal flush).

 The fold my hand line was in reference to giving up on this and going for something that will be very stable, and there are many others who struggle with that too.

The next line was just saying like, you have no idea what's in store, so why stress about something that is completely out of your control?

The aggression line is following the ""hits go over fences"", which is a double entendre on ""making hits"". You have to swing aggressively to hit it out of the park, also saying just let out all the stress and just fuckin swing. 

""Motive is so expected"" means basically what you said, and the ""golden pendant"" and ""lexus"" are kinda cliche, ""expected"" motives for a rapper.

""I've fallen far but I'm climbin up"" is just saying I've been through some shit recently, but I'm working on myself and gettin out of my rut. 
""Time is up"" means I have no time to waste in making a decision. ""You gunna shine or what? the tears you dropped finally dryin up"" means the past is now behind me (tears are dryin up) so now the time to go do my thing.

By ""They lied"" I mean outside influence/the social pressure to do something normal and have a stable life.

At the end of my verse, I'm essentially saying I'm going to chase this ""life to look forward to"".

I probably missed some shit, I tried to keep this as brief as possible (and still failed). But hopefully I cleared it up a little bit. If not just lemme know, I'd be happy to answer whatever.

He loves it, he's smart, he's an insanely passionate player with some dumbass incidents from college.

Jameis compares to JaMarcus like Ryan Leaf compares to Andrew Luck."

Would a warrant be OK'd if they found this was happening out of a McDonald's? Does the level of security on the network have any play in the decision?

People are focusing on a single word rather than the message.  Perhaps he shouldn't have used the word 'invite' but it's minor semantics.  

In the perfect world we wouldn't have to worry about shit like this happening - it's not a perfect world.  

Women walking alone at night are putting themselves in a vulnerable position.  So are men who walk alone at night.   Scumbags prey on the vulnerable.  

The witch hunt is unbelievable, he isn't blaming the victim whatsoever..   He's an ex cop, he has a family... He shouldn't have said 'invite' but fair dinkum this is a total over reaction to a guy who's heart is in the right place and is offering his thoughts to the media.   

Walking alone at night is dangerous.

cqugv12&shield&Dregride&"According to marvel, all the movies take place relative to their release dates. Which means that it's been at least a year and half since she started training with Ward and than may later on. And given that in the pilot extremis is still new the first season takes place at most a month after iron man 3, which makes sense it felt like a lot of time passed in between those early episodes. So, two years of training. And let's not forget May Ward Widow And Bibbi have been seen plowing through groups of enemies with guns using melee combat. 

Skye? In this fight scene she's relying heavily on her gun, taking cover, missing a few times, and it looked like she was able to use her power to gain some form of spatial awareness. She even had the element of suprised for a bit there. If she was fighting that group no gun and no cover she probably would've lost. And then there's a theory that like in the comics each inhuman has at least some enchanced strength and agility given that we see gordon throw cal into the wall from a standing position in ep16

Looking at everything we have been given, I think that fight was completely plausible. "

cqugv2m&AskReddit&fhsd4264&"Okay, I might sound stupid here but I hope you at least read this.

I don't think gravity is a ""fact"". But then, I am interpreting fact in this case to mean ""is true and will always be true"". For all the data we see everyday, when we are on the Earth's surface (or near it), when we let go of something, it tends to go down. For all we know, one day we will let go of something that has always fallen to the ground, but for some weird inexplicable reason it will go up. Given the current data, that seems extremely unlikely, however i think it is certainly within the realm of possibility. I think what is fact is the phenomenon that any given thing I can let go of will drop to the Earth because it is observed for that point in time and will always be true.

In contrast, I think evolution is a phenomenon, but the theory of evolution is just a theory. For all we really know, there will be a point where we just all stop changing. Again, seems unlikely given current data and the size of the current data set... but hey.

Granted, I think that you are sort of avoiding ""reality"" if you choose not to ""believe"" in gravity and the theory of evolution because that's honestly our best explanation. It's like refusing a parachute when you go skydiving because even though the number of people who have survived with a parachute greatly exceeds the number of people who have survived without, and then jumping based on belief. It's not going to end well."

The whole thing always just becomes more than I can stand. I feel like there's something so completely wrong about spending that much of your life at work. I know lots of people feel like that and most people suck it up and get on with it, so I feel useless for not being able to hack it. I do have an anxiety disorder so that's part of it.

I work freelance from home at the moment, which is great but not quite enough money to live off (my husband mostly supports me, but we are soon to separate so I'm going to have to find something else). I've been mostly applying for part time jobs I can do alongside my freelance work, or jobs where I can work from home, or jobs that are within walking distance from my house so it minimises the time I have to spend commuting on top of work hours (luckily I live in an inner city suburb so that's actually feasible).

cqugv3b&fireemblem&Model_Omega&"Dark magic is overall bad in FE6, your options are super limited and the mages even moreso. Though Apocalypse is pretty nuts.

Ray is... not impressive at all, but compared to Sophia he might as well be freaking Pent, and Niime... well I'll get back to you once I've acquired the 3 or so Angelic Robes to make her usable.

Anyway Ray is just underwhelming, pretty much any trained mage at this point will dance circles around him and his growth is not enough to catch up IMHO. If I didn't feel compelled to use every legendary weapon, I wouldn't even use dark mages in FE6, too much hassle.

cqugv46&technology&Nightcaste&"It would certainly be *possible*.  However, it would be hard to implement because the people that run the app stores aren't necessarily the same people that bill you for data usage.

Another issue I see is that what might be a ""Premium"" app with one carrier might not be with another carrier.  If you switch, the app you paid for and developed a habit of using is suddenly eating your data.

Since mobile phone companies already have you over a barrel I don't see why they would suddenly start doing things that only serve to reduce their profit.  There is no incentive for the mobile carriers to go through with a suggestion like this because they don't get any of the money you spent to buy the app.  

A parallel to your idea is that my ISP doesn't throttle my bandwidth when playing a particular online game.  Why would my ISP do that, when the subscription fee to the game goes to the people that run the game, not the ISP?  It wouldn't be a sound business decision."

cqugv66&IAmA&whymauri&This was actually one of the most interesting questions/replies in this thread for me, too. 
cqugv67&ontario&PoorSamPeabody&"copypasta key notes from the AG Report:

*  Ontario roads have consistently ranked among the safest in North America. 
 * measured by calculating the number of collision-related fatalities for every 10,000 licensed drivers. 
* Overall, fatalities in Ontario have decreased between 2002 and 2012
  * (preliminary results show an increase in the number of deaths on Ontario highways in 2013 where snow, slush or ice was a factor.)
* Ontario is among several other cold-climate jurisdictions that use performance-based contracts for winter highway maintenance. 
 * in a performance-based contract, the [Ministry] sets standards and outcome targets for the contractor to meet. The contractor...performs the patrols to determine what’s needed, and plans and manages all the work...the contractor decides how to deliver the end result. 
 * In Canada, British Columbia and Quebec have followed the same 
trend. 
 * Outside Canada, Alaska, Finland, Norway and Sweden apply a performance-based approach to highway maintenance.
* Key observations by the Auditor General on the deterioration of service under performance-based contracts:
 * Contractors under performance-based contracts used less equipment, which resulted in a reduction in service
 * Contractors under performance-based contracts used less treatment material to service highways — spreading materials such as salt, sand and anti-icing liquids to treat highways.
 * Contractors under performance-based contracts patrolled less often, resulting in service failures...less “eyes on the road”
 * The procurement process did not adequately factor in contractors’ ability to deliver required services
 * Audit targets not being met...Over-reliance on contractors’ self-reporting...Monitoring tools lacking...Information for decision-making lacking.
 * Procuring the lowest-bidding contractor can cost more in the long run. (one case where the second-lowest bidder for a contract had a much greater equipment complement than the lowest bidder, which won the contract. If the second-lowest bidder hadn’t lost out on the contract, the area could have been served with significantly more equipment at a significantly lower cost.)

However, I'd like to know what the ""least wastage"" route is.  (Not melding unless I have to - for that reason I have avoided melds on my left side AFs)

Initially I was thinking of just getting a friend to craft Artisan and max meld it.  People seem to have different thoughts on what the optimal meld on Apron and Off hand is and with the expansion coming, I'm not sure if I should go for crafted Artisan only to replace it after levelling to 60.

I was thinking of getting Artisan BSM crafted, using BSM to get to Supra (Is this even possible). Then using BSM to craft CRP tool, and crafting all offhand artisan tools.

My questions is - Is turn in Artisan gear + max meld belt and right side + some meld of OH tool + food enough to get Supra/craft 4*?
How would I meld that OH?
If not. what is the minimal set of crafted/melded Artisan thats worth investing in?

cqugv7n&AskReddit&IAMYourReason&"a) CS has a shitload of cheating going on
b) Some CS curricula teach functional prog first, which if done purely functionally has no mutable state i.e. no variables
c) You sometimes get paradigm-shifts in intro prog, i.e. the first two semesters might be an OO language like Java or a hybrid language like Python where the notions of declaring variables are a bit different than something like C. Also the terminologies vary between these languages.

I'm not saying it's excusable to be in a third-semester course not knowing how to declare variables, but these are some ways that it can happen."

cqugvaq&AirForce&eodryan&"Watch bookoo.  It depends on when you get here.  See everyone leaves then the new people come in, so if you can buy a beater for a year you can get some great deals.  It isn't hard to get a decent car for around 2-3k.  You can definately find 1k or 500 dollar cars but they're basically expendable and there is little chance of you getting your money back from them.  Germans have pretty strict rules for stuff like rust, tire wear, no lights on the dash when you get inspected etc.  This means that with a shitty car, you can end up having to put more money to fix the car than you paid for it when it was registered.

Prices are better on used cars and worse on new cars because essentially every dealer has a monopoly on the new cars because you have to have a US stamped car to bring it back to the states.  This means that you basically get it imported back from the states unless it's like a BMW or something that has programs for that.

Volvo has a program where they will ship back your car for free if you buy a new one, so if you're married, or get married here, you can actually bring home 2 cars.  It's about 1k to ship a car.

For used cars, everyone uses bookoo which is annoying, because it's a website that shuts down on sunday (wtf?).  It's a good place to watch for used stuff and it's mostly Military people selling stuff."

cqugvbw&AskReddit&bdnicho&"Typically the employer will withhold a certain percentage of your pay check depending on how much you make, how many dependents you have, and if you have any relevant tax credits. 

At the end of the year you'll get a form (W2) that sums your total earnings and total withheld for taxes. Then, you compare that value to how much you should've paid for the year and either pay the difference to the IRS if your employer didn't withhold enough, or get a refund for the difference if your employer withheld too much.

Normally you can ask them to change the withholding amount up or down. Just keep in mind that at the end of the year you're responsible for paying the amount required. So if you drop your withholdings down then you'll take home more per paycheck but you'll have to come up with a lump sum to pay the difference by the tax deadline April 15th.

So due to the low angle between the ground and the photographer what you are seeing is a compressed version of the undulating runway. Its that simple. The runway does in fact have those rises and falls.

To clarify a little bit....
A wide angle lens will stretch a scene. If you have a subject in the foreground and some objects off in the distance in the background, it will appear to increase the distance between the subject and the background and make the background look a lot farther away from the subject than it really is.

A long zoom lens will compress a scene. So if you have the same exact scene with a subject in the foreground and an object in the background, the zoom brings the object in the background ""closer"" to the subject and makes it appear to be much closer than it really is."

""The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the American Kennel Club (AKC), the Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA), and other industry groups have urged the Maryland Court of Special Appeals to throw out the jury award for emotional distress. These groups make enormous profits off of the emotional bond between humans and animal companions. Yet these same groups hypocritically seek to limit damages solely to an animal’s “economic” or “market” value in the courts.""

cqugvfa&BF_Hardline&ChaoticNeutralCop&"BFBFC2 was a wonderful game during its time, but I would say currently BF4 is the best true battlefield game you could play. I love BFH for what it is, and I appreciate it for that, but I don't really see it as a ""battlefield type"" game. Coming from BFBC2/BF3/BF4, BFH feels like a spin off, or a CQC expansion. I would agree that BF4 would be hard to jump right into if your only BF experience has been hardline, especially since most of the player base is veterans now. If you enjoy CQC and low TTK, constant action combat, I would stick with BFH. If you enjoy vehicle warfare and large maps, tactical warfare, and slower/skill-based TTK, I would give BF4 a go. Personally I think theyre both great games, but they're not as similar as their names suggest."

cqugvfu&explainlikeimfive&[deleted]&"So sampling is a slightly different but related issue. When you create an original work of music, you automatically get a copyright--there's a copyright for the performance and for the actual notation/""what's on paper."" publishing a work gives you certain rights pertaining to suing someone in fed court and the ways you can calculate damages (money you get if you win). As for sampling, if you use someone else's copyrighted work without their permission (copyright gives you the power to license, sell, distribute, market, and reproduce the work) they can sue you. The court will ask whether there was an improper appropriation of the material under what's known as the Arnstein test and go from there. Basically, did the artist copy the other artist without permission?

As for royalties, you register with a company like bmi or ascap to collect royalties for you. Royalties is the payment for being able to license intellectual property. The copyright owner gives spotify a non exclusive license and in return, spotify pays them a royalty. Not sure what the precise issue you're asking about it but royalties are determined by contract and would depend on if it's going through the artists label, if they are doing it direct, etc"

After living through the emergence Fox News and right wing radio punditry, the conflagration of Christian fundamentalism and evangelicalism, and the rise of the TEA Party, I realize that the country has really begun to split apart.

The thing with Bernie Sanders is, his positions are diametrically opposed to all of that, and they all make a hell of a lot of sense.

I hate dual cannon. This abomination does not fit current gameplay: shoot and hide behind cover. Other tanks only show up briefly, prowler needs twice as much time. Also, shooting down esf is impossible. Hitting esf once? Difficult. Twice? Fuck it, impossibru. I also hate that unless I anchor, velocity of bullet is SO FUCKING SLOW

What I love? Tbh nothing comes.to my mind

I prefer gunning. My situational awareness as driver is bad, I position myself badly

I hate deeply tank fights. It sucks. Hurr, shoot and hide. And again. And again. So fucking boring, without flanking tank fights could last hours without casualties. Out of zerg tanks are moving sniper rifles with bullshit accuracy

Thus is not a tank fight, its a damn Hollywood showcase with main hero capable of turning wrecked vehicle into shiny new tank

I solo because I don't belong to any outfit and none of my friends play this game anymore. No rules, gunner is an addition, not necessity

Strike an eye with the extended digits and strike between the jaw and neck of the person. This usualy leads to them being on the ground or incapacitated and in serious pain. DO NOT, use this lightly, it can cause blindness and I don't think you want a law suit. Aside from this hit light deadlifts and bench press, say 200lbs bench and 300lbs deadlift every night for a year. This lets you hit harder and stengthen your core allowing you to take more abuse.

You've been trying to tell me my opinion and preferences are wrong, and as you say, saying my reasons aren't reasons (which is crazy).

Also haven't changed my reasoning for liking consoles. I didn't mention my reason for single player games outside of just liking it (which, apparently, isn't rational by your standards). So I gave you an ADDITIONAL reason. And no those friends are also on PC, we just prefer using XB1 for chatting. In all fairness we'll use it even when we're on PC unless it's something like GW2 where the whole guild or server or whatever is on some mutual chat program.

Here's what I've gotten from this whole pile of bullshit. I like something for a multitude of reasons. I prefer those reasons over what PC provides. You think that's absurd, and crazy, and are trying to convince I'm crazy and should value PC over console. I disagree and here we are.

Physically attacking me, or taking or damaging my property. I used to become irrate over arguments, but I think that will just pass, for you the way it did for me.

For now? Try and be more empathetic. Ask yourself and your offenders ""why?"" You were very close! When you shouted ""what the fuck!?"", just make it a serious question. You could have stomed over to him and yelled ""WHAT THE FUCK DUDE WHY DID YOU JUST DO THAT!!?"" He would have cowered exactly like you said he did, because he still would have been  scared of you breaking his head, only he would have begged you not to hurt him. You could habe demanded his explaination and forth right apology. Loudly, because your head just got slammed and you're super pissed about it. It's then you would have discovered that he lost his temper the same way you would have, he would have said he was sorry because he really did mean it, and you would have felt a tiny bit better and stormed off to cool down, and then you would have been ***really*** proud of yourself for not killing him and geting sent to the baby clink.

All you have to do is stall your fists with questions and internal conflict long enough to either realize you're in the wrong, realize the consequences of your actions, or figive the offender or feel a little better because of the answers/reactions to those questions, or all that apply."

cqugvqh&linux_gaming&PyGuy&"Probably a shot in the dark, but have you tried going into Nvidia X Server Settings (nvidida-settings) and setting the resolution in the drop-down menu in X Server Display Configuration? I can't seem to get my system to output at 144 Hz without specifying that in nvidia-settings. I understand this is resolution we're talking about, but hopefully this'll point you in the right direction.

Also, this command may be worth a shot.

    xrandr --output DVI-I-1 --mode 2560x1080 --rate 60.0

The DVI-I-1 bit should be changed depending on what kind of output you're using, whether it be DisplayPort (DP-0), HDMI (HDMI-0), and so forth. Type    xrandr -q for more info that's explicitly relevant to your display that's outputting Ubuntu. After all, it could be ""DP-4"" for some reason, like it is for my DisplayPort setup."

I've only made IPAs with it so far, but they all turn out beautifully -- nice fruity esters that mix with hops but don't get in the way, good attenuation, and a beautifully soft mouthfeel that belies the beer's dryness. I imagine it would be great in just about any American or English style, to be honest.

It can get a tiny bit hot/fusel-y if you ramp the temperature up too quickly -- it seems like leaving it no higher than 68°F until it's nearly done fermenting is the right move, followed by bumping it up a few degrees at the end."

Now that TDK is in the LCS, is there any other organization or team that you're still close to within the challenger scene? 

To Remilia: Had you not joined the Misfits, do you think you would have just stayed out of challenger teams? Was there a specific person that persuaded you to join the team, or was it how the team was presenting itself that appealed to you?

To Hermes: How much analyzing versus coaching do you do? At the same time, how, or what, do you coach? Do you just say ""hey I notice you're not so good at X, you should work on it"" or is it more like ""Hey here's a strat I want to try out, mind if we do it at the next scrim?""

cqugvwe&calmhands&progidek&"I was in the almost exact same situation. I'm at your age and I've been doing the same as you. Few months ago I said no to biting and fortunately it worked. I made something like a mental barrier in my mind, it tells me I just can't bite my nails more, even if I put them in my mouth. I have no idea how I made it, it just came out naturally. It's kinda tricky, but the point is to control yourself as often as you can and find out what helps you to stop biting.

I just have problem with scraping my teeth against nails and hooking one against another. It's so annoying to me and I can't stop doing this. I sometimes bite the skin around but I try to get over it and I think that's not a big deal for me. I try to control myself everytime I do this but it doesn't help. It seems like the only way to stop doing this, is to cut my nails very short but I want them to be longer.

cqugvwi&streetwear&yung-nivek&"as far as streetwear goes...

jeans = decent quality for the money but for an extra $10-$20 you can get levi or another higher quality brand. they tend to fit well though, imo. would recommend, though you're getting what you pay for.

t shirts = the cheapest quality i've ever seen. you're much better off copping some fruit of the loom/hanes when it comes to plain t's. though there are some cheap ""elongated"" ones if you're into that. stay away from the lame graphic ones, period. 

button ups = pretty good for the money. fit well (on me) and would recommend. 

hoodies = the best bang for your buck you can get, really. would also recommend

joggers/sweats = fit odd and shrink super fast. would not recommend, but for the money I don't know what else to recommend. just like the jeans, throw in an extra $20 and get an entry level pair at pacsun or something. (as long as they arent some lame brand like been trill)

shoes = i guess the knock off vans/chucks are decent. i've seen a lot of people rock the leather chelsea boots too, though i hear they arent very durable."

cqugvwm&AskReddit&Crocs_with_socks&I started having this crazy vivid wedding dream when I was around 5 and had it on and off for ~10 years. I haven't had it for a few years though. The first time I dreamt it I had never actually BEEN to a wedding so I don't know how I had gotten it so accurate but it was the exact same thing every time. basically it was a wedding on some windy hill somewhere and I was there with my family. I remember everyone who was sitting around me's faces perfectly although I'd never seen them before in my life. It's just a regular wedding when I notice the wind starting to pick up, and then I start to hear a bunch of dogs barking far away. The wedding continues like normal, like no one can even hear these goddam dogs barking their heads off. The dogs get louder and I can't even hear what anyone is saying anymore. This part always made me really unexplainably anxious and I asked my mom if she heard the dogs too. She replied but I couldn't hear her over the barking and the wind. I was freaking out so I got up and ran to the parking lot to hide in our car. In the strangely empty car park was only our car as soon as I reached it I glance back and see a lone really mangy dog just sitting and staring at me. The car is locked. I wake up.

It's also good to remember that hobbies are just hobbies. Your mental health is much more important than any hobby could ever be. Trust me, getting over depression and losing a hobby is much better than keeping your hobby but losing your mental health. 

Try to get some help, if not from a doctor, at least from an online support group. There are lots of those even here on Reddit and many outside of it. "

During the 3.5 sec, the buff wears off but you can still activate a block and proc her super passive. So activating her super passive requires a block within the 5 sec buff window, or 3.5 s after the buff. Hence 8.5 sec after initial block.

cqugvxe&askscience&Madenmann&"I see nothing that would have us go outside and take a walk over green fields.
But i figure somewhere along the line we will have figured out how to perpetually recycle things in some sort of habitat being powered by fusion power or something we'll just search for such a planet elsewhere.


Or maybe we won't do that and just stay in our spaceships; that would be when scientific progress moved beyond our modern day science fiction.
Even the most advanced scifi set in the most advanced age tells us that replicated food somehow doesn't taste very well and that recycled air is somehow stale.

Planetary life seems to be quite a bit better. But what if it wasn't?

Until the sun starts to go red we'll either go extinct or go visit other stars. And then have Children who travel through the void, who then have Children who do the same and so on.

How many generations and how much progress would it take until the humans do no longer feel the need to bother with planets?"

Second Ability is called Donuts for days
-SUV spins in a circle 2 twice hitting enemies around him. Any enemy hit with both spins is mezed
Third ability is called Ill Pick You Up Bro

It's terrible what this man and other religious people get up to. But recently in the UK we have seen teachers, doctors, politicians, celebrities caught out in this kind of thing. They have all, presumably, used their own variations of the script. They each abused power. It looks like the inquiry will show abuse all over the place. And I have no reason to believe similar levels of abuse do not occur elsewhere.  

I find it unimportant what reasons they use and what morality they claim, it's my morality that's offended.

Rakt and Wallace both raise an eyebrow and ready defensive stances as Clay backs away from the door.

cqugw2m&Libertarian&Zenitram&"Well, I know plenty of people that believe living fifty miles from where they work is rational because they have a car and it's cheap. Maybe they haven't even considered the alternatives or are simply afraid of moving. Maybe the poor rationalize their living situation based on proximity to family, or friends, or other things they deem valuable. Maybe some pay more for rent for the same reason. Your rationale, and what perceive to be rational means nothing.  

My original point was that the ""rational actor"" theorem only stands on it's own feet when we consider that the actors will pay for their actions and not get bailed out or subsidized for them. "

cqugw4n&Pathfinder_RPG&Overthinks_Questions&"I enjoyed this thread. One thing that I find helpful for making memorable characters is the Intelligent Item personality quirks d100 table. Most could be used with characters as well, and even if none of them tickle your fancy they might inspire you to come up with your own. For example, my Cleric of Madness and Deception is pansexual...literally. He constantly steals or borrows pans to perform a 'purification ritual' for a few minutes in private. He also cannot resist scrolls, and will disregard all danger to get his hands on them. Whenever he sees a deep hole, he casts light on a rock and drops it down, because it looks cool to him. He eats any fungus or lichen around.

Things like that are fun because the other players begin to anticipate what you'll do and behave accordingly. If a room description includes phrases like ""the cavern is lit by softly glowing mushrooms"", the other party members will wrestle me to the ground so I don't poison myself...again. If we find an abandoned campsite with a pan over the fire, they know that I'll be off in my tent for a few minutes. If there is a pile of scrolls in the next room, everyone draws their weapons and starts pre-buffing because they *know* I'm about to trigger a fight.

tl;dr - Deep motivations and personal histories are great, but personality quirks are an amusing and more frequently available method of role-playing."

cqugw7z&roadtrip&hibrie&Reserving a campsite at Big Sur is a notoriously challenging undertaking. Some make you reserve a full year in advance, some the month of. It depends on the state park and who runs the campsites, but it's best to do your research. I've heard many people try to log in and reserve at the specified time, only to see the reservations have already been sold out -- you have to be quick! When we drove down Highway 1 last Christmas (easily the most beautiful drive I've ever driven) we ended up booking an Airbnb rental in Carmel, CA and exploring Point Lobos for a weekend. I highly recommend it! [THIS](https://instagram.com/p/xIitWaEQ5f/) is one of my favorite photos from that weekend -- every curve looks like this for miles and miles. Unbelievable. If you ever need recommendations, I'm happy to help! I live in the Bay Area, so we frequent Highway 1 quite a bit. Thanks again for your help!

cqugw8c&legaladvice&BabySealHarpoonist&"That's really inconvenient, but it doesn't really change my response. If you don't want to keep paying out the nose just go to the pharmacy once to request an extra bottle, and then just refill it with the mail order prescriptions as need be. When the prescription on the bottle reaches it use before date, go back to the pharmacy for the prescription and request a new bottle. That's almost definitely no more legal than simply keeping the drugs in a different unmarked container, but in a practical way nobody would ever know. That's assuming that you get the same brand from your insurance as you would the pharmacy. 


Otherwise you could probably just find a way to request your mail order pharmacy send you an extra bottle. That's probably better. "

cqugw8s&comicbooks&rufio_vega&"Tony gave them something to fight for. Better to have tried and failed than to have never tried at all. This is a dichotomy seen with Tony and Reed. Tony presumed that they would ultimately fail, but continued to fight anyway. Reed hoped they would succeed, and thus continued to fight for this small sliver of hope. But unlike Reed, Cap's hope blinds him to everything else going.

As it is, they all fought for their lives. They stood against the might of the various galactic empires and the all-powerful Beyonders. Had Tony never pushed them to try, they'd simply have waited for an end they didn't even know was coming, just like the heroes of Earth 1610.

Steve would have looked for an out. Some all-saving option that just wasn't possible. Steve wanted to save everything. But Tony and the others (including Valeria and Doom) were well aware that death was inevitable. They fought for the hope of survival.

Valeria was right. It wasn't about winning. It was about trying not to lose."

cqugw9f&syriancivilwar&crazedmongoose&"So recently I've been coming to the view that we've had our prejudices all backwards.

It's easy to see these conservative, insular immigrant communities and believes that the radicalization happens there. But I am now basically of the view that the recruitment method of ISIS in the West is more akin to attracting lone wolves - internet radicalization, they turn you against the community and family, teach you to hide your motives etc.

Because you know what is a trademark of conservative insular communities? They are *very* risk averse. They want to see their sons and daughters lead safe, boring, happy and prosperous lives. Yeah they might have some antagonistic ideas about the West and some shady views on gender roles, but they are certainly risk-averse. It's a completely different and even counter-vailing force that is convincing these young men and women to go on such a dangerous journey."

cqugwal&chicagoroommates&codantas&"Hey if you are still looking check out my posting :) 

Hi everyone!

My friend and I are both graduates from Iowa State University and we are looking for a third roommate who would want to sign a lease in July 1st. We found an awesome apartment in Lincoln park but they only have 3 bedroom units so that's why we are looking to a third person! Its a 3 bedroom/1 bathroom, with AC, gym, little outdoor area, covered parking for $150/month, on site laundry, doorman, and potentially a great view :) It's a 10 minute walk from the red/brown line and a couple blocks from the lake! There is also a bunch of restaurants and shops around so you can find what you need within walking distance. We already talked to the real estate agency and have a video of the place if you would like to see it! 

About us:
-We are both 23 
-We are really chill and fun and are looking for someone who just wants to have a good time!
-We are not smokers 
-We do love pets but I am allergic so we can't have them around :/
- We are both really social and love meeting new people so we are always down for happy hour, festivals, concerts, dinner dates, you name it :)
- During the week we will be busy with work but night time (and rainy days lol) is usually when we like to sit on the couch watch netflix and drink wine lol 
- On weekends we like to go out and try out new bars/clubs/restaurants. We would prefer not to have a lot of people over but we would definitely be down for pregames with friends!
- Outdoor activities are a plus - so beach, biking, running, snowboarding,etc... 
-We are not clean freaks but we do like to keep things tidy!

If you think you have similar interests to us feel free to contact me at cdantas@iastate.edu!
We honestly just want to find someone who will get along well with us and potentially be a good friend! "

I admit that I feel we defined all the crimes so far and severity classes of crimes is getting into some subjective parts of the law that I'm not too familiar with. In my experience, criminals have been held until either the vault owner accepted the plea for release, or when the subreddit got pissed off enough.

Heck, with Libertas around, it's possible we would not be allowed to hold criminals if they pay reparations. Thus that cuts down how much punishment we could give."

cqugwcu&TownofSalemgame&Baboopolis&At the point where you realized the other veteran wasn't smart enough to realize you couldn't be one, you should have revealed that he must be lying because there can only be one veteran. Then obviously the other guy will know you're lying and will lead a charge against you thinking that you're serial killer or mafia. Obviously he's not smart enough to figure out you were lying so I wouldn't expect him to think you are Jester.

Now it makes sense though I have no idea if the guys claims that the company was out to get him because he reported a financial misdeed is true.

Anyways just another reason to not get married or at least have accounts that can't be touched during a divorce. Divorces can take over a year to be finalized, freezing all of your money is no joke.

I'm a bit confused reading this forum because on the one hand I had heard for so long how Strome will for sure be that big number one center every team needs, who we can build the franchise around for the next 15 years.  You'd think a 28 year old one-dimensional winger who's got maybe half as many years left would be a fair price to pay.

cqugwep&DotA2&Noblewingz&"Hey I'm a 5k mid in NA and play competitive too and although were not great we are in JDL division 2 going up against teams like Col, Levi, ect so were not total shit.

On the pooling of a bottle, I've had it done to me and I've been pooled myself, and honestly it's not too big of a factor in lane. Most mids lvl 1 spells are not very strong to begin with besides a few exceptions (qop so on), so spamming them with your bottle regen isn't going to be useful. Along with this on the heroes that do spam lvl 1 spells, they would most likely have bottle anyway, before ever needing mana. Hp wise, it again doesn't help very much. It will maybe let you get a few extra cs in the first 2 minutes, before the enemy has bottle, but besides that it doesn't provide anything. The real reason it can be useful is EITHER in melee mids that have trouble getting bottle anyway (Ember, so on), or on heroes that want a super fast item timing and it will speed them up by 700+ gold (Naga, so on). On paper it look's fantastic, but really is only super useful in a couple of unique situations.

Edit: After seeing the rest of the replies it seems I'm a minority thinking it's not very good so before down votes come in, so you can google me if you want proof on my MMR and I'm totally willing to try some 1v1s with you while you get a free bottle at start to prove my point! Maybe I'm wrong who knows, but I'll try to put it from my perspective as best I can."

cqugwf0&videos&[deleted]&"As a Korean-American who has heard this sentiment expressed before by black people during the L.A. riots, let me tell you this: When they say that Asians just ""take, take, take,"" I believe they are referring to the idea that Asians open up businesses in black neighborhoods and only hire their own family members rather than hiring people of the community. Therefore, we are taking black money without giving anything back (i.e. jobs).

I have to say that I do understand their point of view when it comes to this. After the L.A. riots, a lot of Korean business owners actually realized this and started making changes. They started hiring more people of the community they were opening up shop in.

I just wanted to mention this because there seems to be a lot of hate and casual racism in this thread. I do think black people have a reason to be mad when it comes to this."

cqugwf6&polyamory&ofblankverse&"Poly and Mono people have the same insecurities, it's just that different things trigger different people's worries. So the first thing you do is pay very close attention to your feelings. What are you feeling, and what triggered it? Can you explore WHY? Is there a false belief behind the worry, and can you replace it with a new, more true belief? Can you ask your partner to do or say something that would help you solidify this new belief, or can you do it by yourself? How easy is it for you to talk about your insecurities with your girlfriend? If there's anything making you hesitant, [figure out what it is and talk about that too](http://kimchicuddles.com/post/49797164576/no-sleep). Find things you love to do alone for the nights you will inevitably spend alone while she's with other partners. Get used to going through a LOT of emotional processing, both together and alone. Anything in life offers really big rewards is going to be really hard work. It's up to you to decide if that's work you want to take on. :)

cqugwgr&Albany&BCNJ09&"I'd strongly recommend looking at extended stay hotels if you're only going to be here for 10 weeks. You can usually negotiate a reasonable rate with the manager and you wouldn't have to worry about furniture, utilities, or anything else -- it's all included, of course.

That said, if you have a higher budget (I know you said cheap, but everyone has different definitions), there are some nice furnished corporate apartments (usually for longer stays, but still) in the area -- I'd recommend River's Edge in Green Island (http://www.albanyriversedge.com/execustay/) since it's close to RPI and has some pretty nice amenities.

As far as extended stay hotels go, there's a Residence Inn in East Greenbush, roughly a 15 minute drive from RPI. I stayed at a Residence Inn for a few months once and really liked it, for what it's worth. Residence Inn tends to be on the more expensive side, so you might be able to negotiate a better rate at an Extended Stay America or something similar. Other hotels might be worth a look too, if you don't really need a full kitchen."

cqugwhh&sex&sinfulminded&I don't think she should expect you to go down on her because she does to you, but she's communicated with you about how she likes it and wants you to and you haven't done anything about it. You're saying maybe one day you'll come around to it but I think you should actually do that instead of putting it off. I know some won't agree but I feel like if you really care about someone, you'll do things even if it doesn't do anything for you.

In my region the Playstation Store version of Project Cars is priced over US$90. Steam store version is priced over US$65.

I feel very fortunate to be able to experience the game at release. I was going to wait for a 50% discount on one of the platforms. Thanks Green Man Gaming!

Note: Green Man Gaming is 100% legit and in this case provides a Steam key for Project Cars. Prices will jump at any time when a publisher remembers to equalise their price with a regionally inflated Steam store price."

cqugwka&Libertarian&MadCervantes&"You've basically proven my point. 20 years ago you could get a decent entry level job without a degree. but NOW you can't. There's a 40% unemployment rate for people between the ages of 18-25. Many many more are unemployed? Times have changed. The economy is a very different place than it was when you were starting out, the 90s tech boom was in full upswing, and there weren't enough CS grads in the world to fill all the positions that being opened. Now 1 in 4 people coming out of college have a CS degree. Transpose your 19 year old self to today's modern economy? Do you actually think you could hack it? 

That's a serious question too. Please, take a moment to actually think about what I'm getting at here. I know it's an easy defense mechanism to say ""I earned everything I have!"" Because you have earned everything you have, but things aren't the same as when you were young. Things have changed. The world is a very different place now. "

cqugwna&AskHistorians&DuxBelisarius&"The only examples that I can think of are in Serbia and in Occupied Belgium and France.

In Serbia, bands of civilians and soldiers, called 'komitadjis', fought against the failed Austro-Hungarian invasion in 1914, and against the Central Powers occupation from Sept. 1915 onwards. Fighting bands like these had already formed in previous years, during the Balkan Wars, and some even earlier in the Bosnia Crisis.

In Belgium and Occupied France, there were underground resistance groups that spied on the Germans and passed information to the British and French. They also helped to get Allied POWs back to friendly territory, either across the lines or via neutral Netherlands. "

With Yosemite(10.10), however, they changed the behavior, so now the maximize button does make the window go full-screen, as most Windows users would prefer, and the old behavior is available if you hold the option key while clicking the maximize button."

cqugwp7&TagPro&GoatButtholes&"A lot of it is just practice. The more you'll play, the better control over your ball you'll have and you can have great precision. 

Another big part of it is mind games. If you're trying to avoid the snipe, a common way to avoid it is to go straight across but just before you'd be in the lane to get sniped, do a full stop and they'll go right past you. Trick is to make them think you're going to be somewhere when you're actually going to switch directions and go somewhere else. Preferably though it's better to have awareness of where all the boosts are and not be in the position to get sniped, but this can be difficult to do on some maps. 

On defense, it's the opposite. You have to be prepared for their a slowing down or speeding up. Usually one of the better ways to gauge when to snipe is to visualize what path your ball will take when you boost, and don't take the snipe until they're like a third of the way into that path. This depends on the length of your snipe though. If it's long range it's harder to do and you might have to hit it before they're in the lane at all so when you do get there, they'll be there too. "

cqugwrn&FanTheories&stryker101&"There's nothing to really suggest that Tatooine is somehow ""Force secular""...

Watto's resistance to Jedi mind tricks is due to his species, not his location, and his species isn't native to Tatooine.

Han's situation is similar. Yes, we first meet the character on Tatooine, but he's clearly traveled all over the galaxy. As for his comment, I think it makes plenty of sense.

Obi Wan says that there are thousands of star systems in the Republic. So while it may seem like we see a lot of Jedi in the prequels- in the grand scheme of things there are remarkably few of them. Most people could easily live out their entire lives without ever meeting a Jedi. Add in the purge, and his comment is how most people would naturally feel about the Jedi.

Imagine if Buddhism had been wiped out 20 years ago, and you'd never met a Buddhist. You could easily call it an ancient religion, and it wouldn't be ridiculous to not believe in karma. That's where Han is coming from there.

The *Rebels* are different. They're military. Their officers (especially the older ones) were very likely to have encountered and worked with the Jedi before the purge. That makes it entirely natural for a higher percentage of Rebels to believe in the Force.

Leia definitely got the better deal when the two were split up. It's possible they sensed Luke would have a stronger connection to the Force, but if that's true, it's never spoken or made clear. Yoda clearly states that if Luke fails they still have her to turn to. That's also why they were split up. Vader didn't know they survived, but if he found one of them the other would still be safe. Bail had wanted to adopt a girl anyway, so he took Leia because he could protect her and provide for her. Yoda and Obi Wan trusted him with that. Luke went to his aunt and uncle because Obi Wan knew Vader would never go back to Tatooine, at least not to visit those two."

cqugwuc&videos&Uncle_Erik&"I'm sorry, but this article is misleading.

How do I know?  I was there.  In 1992 I was a 19 year-old sophomore at USC and I worked nights for UPS, in Vernon, which is just east of downtown LA.  I was working there the night of April 29, 1992.

First, Koreans weren't some singled-out minority.  Koreans are one of *many* minority groups in LA.  LA has Koreatown, Chinatown and Little Tokyo.  There are other ethnic centers all over LA.  I used to eat in Koreatown regularly - like lots of people in LA - and Koreans were as well-regarded as anyone.

Second, Koreatown was **not** singled out by the LAPD.  On the first night, the LAPD disappeared from *everywhere.*  They holed up in Parker Center and did not come out.  So, yeah, of course there was no LAPD in Koreatown.  There was no LAPD in Chinatown, downtown LA, South Central, or anywhere in LA proper.  The only police that were out were the police in suburb cities that had their own police forces.  Again, the LAPD retreated *entirely* from LA.  It wasn't just some, ""hey, screw Koreatown,"" it was ""hey, we're not going out anywhere.""  The Koreans were in the same unfortunate position as everyone else in LA.

Me?  I remember that night well.  We had to shut down the UPS facility, one that handled over 300,000 parcels a day.  We were afraid of it being looted.  After shutting it down, I had to drive back to USC along Washington Blvd.  People were burning and looting just feet away from me.  I thought I was going to be killed that night.  It was complete, total chaos.  The LAPD wasn't to be found anywhere.  They abandoned the city.  

I spent that night up on the roof of the house I lived in.  I watched the city burn.  "

I am not looking forward to be hooked up to anything.  I was hoping to be able to walk around because that's how I best deal with pain.  And it's going to be stressful enough, starting with the fact that we probably don't get to deliver at our original choice of hospital.  

We're bringing me comfy, nursing pjs but I might pick up a long gown just in case.  I'm also hoping they let me eat because I can't go more than 3 hours without something because my blood sugar will get super low.

cqugwvt&mylittlepony&lvlI0cpu&"I would agree that what tends to detract people from the game the most would be the inherent complexity that is found within the game mechanics (too many board positions and triggers to keep track off). I would however disagree on their thoughts on how it should pander to bronies, to which I actually feel like they do a lot given all of the inside jokes on the flavor texts (like my personal favorites [here](http://ponyhead.com/cards/cg100/fashion-upgrade) and [here](http://ponyhead.com/cards/cg80/equestrian-mailmare-special-delivery)) and use of printing several version of fan favorite ponies like Derpy, DJ-Pon3, and Maud. That just seems quite narrow minded assuming this should be exclusively for us, for why would we not want to share our hobbies with others? And seriously though, [Queen Chrysalis](http://ponyhead.com/cards/ad193/queen-chrysalis-commanding-queen) used her Mind Control magic to take control of a pony friend. How is this not a flavor design that most bronies would think is totally awesome? What about [Tirek](http://ponyhead.com/cards/ad159/lord-tirek), who literally is banishing your friends to the Tartarus? And even something like [Luna, Mare in the Moon](http://ponyhead.com/cards/cn196/princess-luna-mare-in-the-moon) is like she is jumping in and out of a dream, just like she did in that very episode! There is a ton of flavor that anybody who watches all of the episodes would be able to recognize. 

That and if Pink in this game has taught me anything, its that you're not ""Killing"" ponies. Viking is the one who is saying the phrase, not anybody else. Just look at some examples from some dismissal cards, like [very startling](http://ponyhead.com/cards/cn125/very-startling), [Party Bomb](http://ponyhead.com/cards/cg138/party-bomb), [Yoink!](http://ponyhead.com/cards/cg124/yoink), and [DJ Pon3 - Loose Cannon](http://ponyhead.com/cards/ad31/dj-pon-3-loose-cannon). They are not being killed, they are either being spooked, scared away, or simply exhausted from too much partying/being sent to a party (which is probably why pinkie's element is the one that gets the most dismisal lol)."

You're right on that, I also feel the same way; I much prefer talking to people who have experienced/are currently experiencing what I'm going through. 



For your smoothies, you can something like peanut butter, nut/seed butters, and unrefined virgin coconut oil. They'll add much needed calories and good taste! I think it's better if you added more fat than protein, because protein has a higher thermic effect and it's also more satiating (good for losing weight, not so good for gaining it).




And, if you ever find yourself in need of someone to talk to, my inbox is *always* open. Feel free to message me anytime you like, for any reason :)

WMF:  

If Bredon is unimportant, who is kvothe(kote) planning to kill in the frame? Between folly, holly, the single perfect step, knowing about Basts letters in a bottle, finally telling the true story of himself, he is preparing for the end. The problem is, a battle of magical proportions has already taken place at Imre, which is likely what killed Cinder...

cqugwz3&news&HereComeTheColdJets&"Grew up not too far in Northern NJ, police are notorious for hassling people for no reason, especially driving while black. That stretch on 287 that passes the exits for Morristown, Madison, and a little down southwards when it turns to 65 are filled with asshole local cops. 

One time when I was driving late at night, I had some local cops ride my ass for 2 miles at a dangerously close distance, then whip around me with the flashlight at full blast and then backed off and pulled me over. Almost had a fucking accident with the blaring light in my eyes. The reason they pulled me over, ""they thought my back passenger wasn't wearing a seatbelt and they wanted to make sure"". Yep doing hazardous driving maneuvers for the sole purpose of potentially issuing a $45 ticket, fucking genius.

The fucked thing is, I've met and read about other people who've driven on that same length of 287 and experienced the same petty run around bullshit from bored cops.

And then of course there was that [whole situation](http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/news/local/2014/05/28/mendham-township-officer-lawsuit-illegal-ticket-quotas/9675785/) with the Mendham cop who spoke up and exposed ridiculous quotas and agendas to specifically target young people.

cqugx1n&LifeProTips&SpykePine&"Probably a little late, but this happened with me. Story time.  
  
Got in an accident, old car was totaled. We had gotten my previous car years prior by working with a fleet dealer, but she no longer worked at the dealership. We had contacted her (she gave us a personal number, which my family kept since she was so helpful), and she gave us the information to contact her replacement.  
  
Due to the distance of the fleet dealer's location, my dad wanted us to shop around first at closer locations (maintenance, etc) even though the fleet dealer assured us she could procure any vehicle from almost any of the same-brand dealerships in the country with a dealer trade. Dad insisted on shopping first.  
  
Find the car I wanted (rare color combo, interior, feature set) at a decently close location. We got there, and they told us it wasn't on site but actually at another dealership but they'd trade for it. My dad and I were suspicious and he kept insisting on seeing the car but it was super late (like, dealership by this time should have been closed by now). We signed a bunch of paperwork anyway (don't know why my dad went against his gut).  
  
Next day, they call us and tell us the car was damaged in the transfer from the other location and ""below their minimum standard to sell to us"" but they wanted us to come in and see other cars (same make, model, different colors, interiors) to replace it.  
  
Dad asks to see the damage, maybe they could just pay for the repairs and call it a day. They refuse. My dad says the contract is void, get us our downpayment check back, etc. Takes him about an hour and a half on the phone between being transferred hither and non.  
  
We contact the fleet dealer (the new one, not the original) and tell her what happened. She said it sounds like they tried a really messy bait and switch, and probably never had the car at all. But she could help us find exactly what we wanted, and cheaper than their offer. We give her the specs we want, she calls us four hours later. It doesn't exist in the country.  
  
Shoot. But she tells us she can do some sort of 1277 or something (requisition order? Dunno, forgot the code) where they cancel a car currently in processing for being built, and build it to our requirements. But it would take 6-8 weeks and come directly off the boat from Germany. We'd just need a deposit, since they're effectively special ordering it for us. Be absolutely sure it's exactly what we want. If it comes in missing anything, wrong detailing etc, we get the deposit, and they eat the cost. They'd also help us cover the car rental partially during that period (not all of it, but part of whatever insurance didn't cover).  
  
Dad sits down with her to haggle price, and her first offer is several thousand below what the shady dealership was giving us, with more features. He didn't even counter-offer, since he didn't think he could even attempt to get it any lower after all the work she did for us. Shows up 8 weeks later, and now I have my car."

Apparently its an issue with the way Nvidia is running Adobe products with its Cuda cores. Nvidia seems to be working on it, but this issue has been going on for probably 6-8 months now. People say it helps to turn off the Mercury Rendering, only run 1 adobe program at a time, and to not run Chrome simultaneously. I've tried all these and it does help, but I have several projects with 5k Epic footage and large stills that continue to have this issue. 

All we can do is wait until Nvidia updates the cuda drivers. I try to check for Nvidia updates once a week. "

Yes things like this happen, perceived behaviours or assumed criminal records, I'm not sure why. You also mentioned fast food and that's fine, however no one can survive on a fast food cheque, fast food employment i imagine was designed for students living with parents and not to sustain an acceptable standard of living. You still haven't mentioned what it is you do to sustain your standard of living which I'm going to assume is ok.

i won't forget almost shitting my pants when i realized sr1 was actually seized, or when sheep went down (although that was somewhat predictable), but then you have sites that get busted like cloud9 that were smooth like BB, and then you have seemingly popular/professional sites like Evo just pull a SheepMP amd walk off with $34 million.

It's a crap shoot either way. Agora some times reminds me of BMR in that sevurity seems to be the number one concern, although Ag is defeinitely more user friendly.

Don't ever let people make you feel like shit because of them, they are a part of you. You should wear them with pride.

As a Korean-American who has heard this sentiment expressed before by black people during the L.A. riots, let me tell you this: When they say that Asians just ""take, take, take,"" I believe they are referring to the idea that Asians open up businesses in black neighborhoods and only hire their own family members rather than hiring people of the community. Therefore, we are taking black money without giving anything back (i.e. jobs).

I have to say that I do understand their point of view when it comes to this. After the L.A. riots, a lot of Korean business owners actually realized this and started making changes. They started hiring more people of the community they were opening up shop in.

I just wanted to mention this because there seems to be a lot of hate and casual racism in this thread. I do think black people have a reason to be mad when it comes to this."

cqugxc0&homestuck&EnigmaRequiem&"Jesus, the last thing I expected on this update was to have black romance explained in an incredibly easy to understand way that can actually be parsed.

Post-Ret-John Karkat confirmed for best at Quadrants?"
cqugxc1&bicycling&lavaslippers&That's great news! It's going to be such an enjoyable way to travel :)
cqugxc2&DeadBedrooms&timetogiveup7&Then don't go onto /r/gwcouples because that depresses me seeing couples having so much fun, what annoys me the most when I look through it is seeing all the cream pies and facials, my gf is on birth control and I'm not allowed near her without a rubber.
cqugxc4&nfl&GilfHouse69&Ya they're never around and I'm allowed to do whatever I want . It's strange. It's almost like I'm a big kid or something. 
cqugxc5&nfl&the_intersect&yea well i hope that chaos ensues!
cqugxc6&explainlikeimfive&ae5rja5ja&"False, there's no legal distinction in copyright for ""residential"" usage. The only protection you might get is under fair use, but internet piracy cases have shown that the non-commercial clause is insufficient by itself to grant fair use."
cqugxc7&Sneakers&shoutsoutstomywrist&Those are the Air About To Dunk On Congress 2 Terms.
cqugxc8&SquaredCircle&Cheeseblanket&No, I don't think any of us have ever wanted Cena to be anything other than a morally perfect Superman.
cqugxc9&CollegeBasketball&cavahoos&Excuse me?
cqugxca&streetwear&Npathak&Sweet thank you! When's you new collection dropping?

cqugxce&minnesotavikings&HEY_AHNOLD&Pick is innn
cqugxcf&nfl&illmaticspence&Browns, Eagles and Titans all draft Marriota and he spits time between all teams during season
cqugxch&NYGiants&YellowG1&The thinking is that Ray will drop out of the first because of the pot arrest. Not sure I believe it but he is getting slammed just like Gregory. These were both guys being talked about as top 10 picks.
cqugxci&gifs&SheepDogxWarrior&It reminds everyone of your ex.
cqugxcj&ElectricForest&rynoIA&Tipper isn't at any of the festivals I will be at this summer. how does that happen. Would love for a late add at Forest
cqugxck&askportland&elmay&My partner dropped her iPhone a couple of weeks ago and I just had it fixed at the Apple store (in Bridgeport if that matters :)). Cost $129. They said it would take 45 min -- I had something else to do so I picked up a couple of hours later.
cqugxcl&religion&WoollyMittens&It is **your** gross oversimplification.
cqugxcm&furry&Ralanost&Do you mean the medicine ball?  I remember how bitter she said it tasted.
cqugxcn&videos&[deleted]&[deleted]
cqugxco&AskReddit&iowamechanic30&If done with that intent I agree it's completely fucked up but there are different levels of drunk. My only point is drunk does not automatically mean foul play, people often have consensual sex when one or both are drunk and have no regrets. Can you honestly say you haven't had sex when drunk (bac over .08).
cqugxcq&relationships&imnotcheatingtho&I have been worried he was just projecting. 
cqugxcr&Browns&ElectricEntity&PICK IS IN!  WE'RE SAFE!
cqugxcs&Tennesseetitans&ILikeTheTitans&My thoughts exactly.
cqugxcv&Omaha&CU_BJay&Late to this, but Hummel park, Iowa western and Mahoney state park are also good 
cqugxcw&flying&BGrishenko&Dude...I couldn't live life without our culture of fear....the thought of not being terrified all the time of Ebola, Terrorism, Global Warming, Economic Collapse and Race riots.....BLAH!, I shudder to think of what would happen if we got rid of those things....it's a terrifying thought. 
cqugxcx&buccaneers&thedaj&BREAK THE SOUTH DOWWWWWWWN
cqugxcy&nfl&Alexlsonflre&I think at least half our fan base is shitting themselves...and these announcers talking about how WE ARE taking Mariota is scaring me.
cqugxcz&malefashionadvice&Jasonz1998&Decided to buy a tux for prom. How do you guys think it fits? [](http://imgur.com/a/SHXQe)http://imgur.com/a/SHXQe

cqugxd1&tifu&joebyron&If i was a bastard, I'd be really confused about who my mom was trying to send those pics to in the first place
cqugxd2&nfl&Wilky323&Remember Whiz is the guy who drafted Matt Leinart. He couldn't evaluate talent for shit here in AZ. 
cqugxd3&wow&[deleted]&[deleted]
cqugxd4&AskReddit&whitepaddedwalls&That's was probably me. And I'll have you know, after a few years of speech therapy, I am mostly better. 
cqugxd5&politics&kcell&"Because politics.

The NRA ""scores"" all kinds of bullshit bills/votes to skew their numbers. Notice how almost all republicans have an A or a 90+ from the NRA, but even pro-gun democrats have C grades."
cqugxd6&funny&Live_Think_Diagnosis&I would. But I'm a weirdo too... 
cqugxd7&MensRights&ellamking&It may be surprising, but some people stay together and don't feel the need to betray each other, instead they both work hard with the comfort that someone has your back if something happens.
cqugxd8&AmiiboCanada&andersonhc&"You shouldn't. Nintendo isn't good in spreading information to all its reps. Most Nintendo employees don't know much about Amiibo. 

The information he gave you seems to be based on him checking Nintendo Amiibo website. "
cqugxd9&movies&stoatflip&I found it shallow and pedantic.
cqugxda&GlobalOffensiveTrade&Leevitation&idk i sold one for 48k last night with 0.17 float 
cqugxdb&IAmA&sharts_with_wolves&What styles of music are you most into?
cqugxdc&writing&dontbothermeimatwork&Screw restructuring the sentence. It's a fine sentence that they are trying to ruin with rules enforcement run amok. 
cqugxdd&skyrim&BurntTheToast&Hololens ready. 
cqugxde&rangers&coltrane2989&Stop fucking passing it in the slot. holy fuck
cqugxdf&hockey&gimmebeer&YOU'D NEVER KNOW IT WITH THESE ANNOUNCERS.
cqugxdg&Austin&nuovo_donna&Yup, and that actually sounds pretty tame compared to the things I've seen and experienced.  A lot of pet owners are really irresponsible and unfortunately it ruins it for everyone.
cqugxdh&mexico&mothmanex&Hola, veo que otros estaban reportando errores, me tope con un error (la verdad en casos muy especificos). Pero al abrir la pagina en resoluciones de 1080p se [asi](http://i.imgur.com/8AZnTMl.png).
